            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>In his article, James Romm explores the enduring mystery surrounding the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, an event that has baffled historians and sparked numerous theories over the centuries. Despite his robust health and seemingly divine status, Alexander’s sudden death at 32 in Babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership, plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the Wars of the Successors. While some historians suggest natural causes like disease, others propose theories of murder, fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death. Oliver Stone’s film </em>Alexander<em> reignited interest in these theories, suggesting a conspiracy among Alexander’s generals. Various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians. Despite extensive historical, forensic, and toxicological research, including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with Alexander’s symptoms, the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation, leaving one of history’s greatest mysteries unsolved.</em></p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">by James Romm</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Babylon on June 11th, 323 BC, at about 5pm, <a href=\"https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/tag/alexander-the-great/\">Alexander the Great</a> died aged 32, having conquered an empire stretching from modern Albania to eastern Pakistan. The question of what, or who, killed the Macedonian king has never been answered successfully. Today new theories are heating up one of history’s longest-running cold cases.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like the death of Stalin, to which it is sometimes compared, the death of Alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible. Conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king’s body was cold, but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects. Fuel was added to the fire by <a href=\"https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/tag/oliver-stone/\">Oliver Stone</a>‘s <a href=\"https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/tag/alexander-2004-film/\"><em>Alexander</em></a>, released in 2004 with new versions in 2006 and 2008: a film that, whatever its artistic flaws, presents a historically informed theory about who killed Alexander and why.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Few events have been as unexpected as the death of Alexander. The king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his 12-year campaign through Asia, enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles. Some had come to think of him as divine, an idea fostered, and perhaps entertained, by Alexander himself. In 325, fighting almost single-handed against South Asian warriors, Alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow, yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches, a 60-day trek along the barren coast of southern Iran.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consequently, when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later, the shock felt by his 50,000-strong army was intense. So was the confusion about who would next lead it, for Alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir (though one would be born shortly after his death). The sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point, the start of a half-century of instability and strife known today as the Wars of the Successors.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes. It is disturbing to think that blind chance – a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito – put the ancient world on a perilous new course. An explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring, even though it involves a darker view of Alexander’s relations with his Companions, the inner circle of friends and high-ranking officers that surrounded him in Babylon.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of Alexander’s death, though many attribute it to disease. In 1996 Eugene Borza, a scholar specialising in ancient Macedon, took part in a medical board of inquiry at the University of Maryland, which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever; Borza has since defended that finding in print. Malaria, smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed, with alcoholism, infection from the lung wound and grief – Alexander’s close friend Hephaestion had died some months earlier – often seen as complicating factors. But some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness, or even to choose between illness or murder: two Alexander experts who once made this choice (one on each side) later changed their opinions to undecided.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With historical research at an impasse, Alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches. Armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology, they are re-opening the Alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idea that Alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in 2004, thanks to the ending of Stone’s film. In its epilogue Alexander’s senior general Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins), looking back over decades at his commander’s death, declares: ‘The truth is, we did kill him. By silence, we consented … Because we couldn’t go on.’ Ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again. ‘You shall write: He died of disease, and in weakened condition.’</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idea that Alexander’s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of Stone’s famously plot-prone imagination. There is some evidence that not even Alexander’s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere. In India in 325 BC, at the eastern edge of the Indus river system, Alexander’s army staged a sit-down strike, when ordered to march eastward towards the Ganges. Even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny. Stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy, since Alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death. ‘I can’t believe that these men were going on with Alexander’ to Arabia and Carthage, he said in a 2008 interview at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that Ptolemy masterminded a cover-up of Alexander’s murder, but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed. The account Ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of Alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the <em>Royal Journals</em>. Though now lost it was summarised (in different versions) by Arrian and Plutarch, two Greek writers of the Roman Empire, who endorsed it as the most reliable record of Alexander’s last days. Some scholars, led by the Australian classicist Brian Bosworth, believe the <em>Royal Journals</em> were falsified to make Alexander’s death appear natural, just as Stone’s film represents (though in Bosworth’s view the culprit was Eumenes, Alexander’s court secretary, rather than Ptolemy). Others disagree, taking the <em>Journals</em> to be just what Arrian and Plutarch thought they were, an undoctored, day-by-day eyewitness account.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n",
            "<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0IwTYtpRPY0?feature=oembed\" title=\"Alexander: The Making of a God | Official Trailer | Netflix\" width=\"1200\"></iframe></div>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The debate over the <em>Royal Journals</em> has huge implications for our understanding of Alexander’s death, because Arrian and Plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources. Both authors say that Alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named Medius. His fever grew worse over the course of 10 or 12 days (the two accounts differ in chronology), leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak. As his troops shuffled past his sickbed, Arrian reports, Alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one. Death followed the next day.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that Stone followed in <em>Alexander</em>. In this alternate version Alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and, more importantly, just as he drained a huge cup of wine. These accounts say that Alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud. From that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms, including great pain, convulsions and delirium, but they say little or nothing about fever, the keynote of the Plutarch and Arrian accounts.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison, which is why Plutarch, in his biography of Alexander, vehemently denied that it had occurred. ‘Some writers think they have to say such things, as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama’, he sneered. Apparently the dispute between those who thought Alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder – essentially, those who did or did not trust the <em>Royal Journals</em> – was already rife in Plutarch’s day. Probably all reports of Alexander’s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is, of course, ‘whodunnit?’ Stone’s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question. In the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the Companions to show that they know Alexander’s cup contains poison, but no clue is given as to how it got there. By contrast many Greek and Roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it, but how and with what poison. With remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at Antipater, the senior general whom Alexander had left in charge of the Macedonian homeland, and at two of his sons, Cassander and Iollas.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Antipater may indeed have had reason to want Alexander dead in the spring of 323 BC, for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to Babylon, perhaps with hostile intent. Antipater stayed put but sent Cassander in his stead. According to several ancient accounts Antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water, collected from the legendary river Styx (believed to flow above ground in the northern Peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld). The water had to be transported in a hollowed-out mule’s hoof, for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn. In Babylon, ran the story, Cassander passed this mule’s hoof to his brother Iollas – conveniently enough, Alexander’s wine-pourer – who then slipped the toxin into the king’s drink.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling, but details vary. Some versions mention the philosopher Aristotle as a co-conspirator; he was a known friend of Antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student Alexander, who had sanctioned the death of his relative Callisthenes. Others make Medius, the host of the final, fatal dinner party and allegedly Iollas’ male lover, a participant in the plot. One very early version, published in an anonymous Greek pamphlet, now known as <em>The Last Days and Testament of Alexander</em>, made Iollas doubly guilty: when the first draught of poison failed to kill Alexander, Iollas administered a second, soaking in Styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until recently historians dismissed the story of the Styx water-poisoning as a fiction, possibly a political smear designed to harm Antipater and Cassander. Both were contestants for power in the era after Alexander’s death and had many enemies, especially Olympias, Alexander’s vengeful mother (who, perhaps to help foster the idea of Antipater’s family’s guilt, eventually had Iollas’ grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind). Even the idea that ordinary Greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd. In 1913 the distinguished classicist J.G. Frazer declared that the waters the Greeks identified as the Styx, today called Blackwater or Mavroneri, contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, in a presentation at a conference in Barcelona in 2010, the historian Adrienne Mayor and the toxicologist Antoinette Hayes proposed that the limestone around Mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin. Chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today (though they may have disappeared over the centuries). Mayor and Hayes argue that ‘calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for Alexander’ – including his high fever, usually seen as proof of a natural death.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The research of Mayor and Hayes might suggest that Alexander was murdered, though the authors themselves stop short of that claim. They are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself. Their thesis that the Styx really was strongly toxic would account for why Antipater and his sons were the ancient world’s prime suspects: Cassander’s journey from Europe to Babylon just a few weeks before the onset of Alexander’s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which Styx water could have arrived at the king’s banquet table. (Cassander later helped confirm the ancient world’s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of Macedonia and executing Alexander’s mother, wife and son.)</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The authors are also interested in how, in the Greek imagination, the mythic resonance of the Styx, a river thought able to stupefy even the gods, made it an ideal weapon for Antipater and his sons to use. ‘Such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to Alexander’, Mayor said recently. ‘An ordinary, common drug would not do. Only a very rare, potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for Alexander.’</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of Antipater’s conspiracy can help crack the mystery. But it is clear that the Mayor-Hayes approach, matching toxins available to the ancient world with Alexander’s reported symptoms, has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery. Three other investigators have pursued it in recent years, combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin: Ptolemy, one of Alexander’s leading generals, committed the murder with arsenic; Rhoxane, the king’s wife, did it with strychnine; Alexander’s physicians did it, but by accident, with powdered hellebore root.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n",

            "<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8776076002137888\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-slot=\"1496043798\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"></ins>\n",

            "</script></div>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the New Zealand toxicologist Leo Schep and the Scotland Yard detective John Grieve. These two men were brought together in a 2009 television documentary, <em>Alexander the Great’s Mysterious Death</em>. Schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore, used medicinally by the ancient Greeks but lethal in large doses, could best account for Alexander’s recorded symptoms. Grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin, as Schep had supposed, but by Alexander’s doctors, who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grieve’s ingenious speculation is only that, but has already won the endorsement of at least one Alexander specialist, the British classicist Richard Stoneman. ‘Hellebore, despite its dangers, was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects’, Stoneman notes. ‘But it was easy to get the dose wrong, and Alexander’s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in Babylon – or even misread the Babylonian label.’</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the toxicology on which Schep and Grieve rely is evidently not an exact science, especially when practiced at a distance of 2,300 years. The author Graham Phillips submitted the same record of Alexander’s symptoms as Schep’s to the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Center but obtained a very different answer. In his 2004 book <em>Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon</em> Phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like Alexander’s.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following a twisting, at times tortuous, trail of logic Phillips tries to identify Alexander’s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine. The poisonous plant is rare along Alexander’s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent (modern Pakistan). Not all of Alexander’s retinue followed him into such areas, allowing Phillips to eliminate potential suspects. He concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill Alexander also had the means: Rhoxane, the first of the king’s three wives. She had become enraged at Alexander, Phillips assumes, by his two subsequent marriages to Persian princesses and killed him. This view of Rhoxane as a latter-day Medea revives one popularised in the 17th-century English tragedy by Nataniel Lee, The Rival Queens, but is not supported by evidence. (Oliver Stone, too, portrays Rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman, though he makes her guilty of the death of Hephaestion – in his view, Alexander’s male lover – rather than Alexander himself.)</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arsenic gets the spotlight in a 2004 book, <em>The Death of Alexander the Great</em> by Paul Doherty, novelist and amateur historian. Doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by Plutarch and the Roman writer Quintus Curtius: Alexander’s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of Babylon for a week or more. Doherty cites toxicology studies of the 19th century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification. However the jury seems to be out on this point and, for obvious reasons, opportunities for field tests are few.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Alexander’s body really did resist decomposition – and some experts consider the story a fiction – then numerous explanations have to be considered. Those who believe Alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol. Strychnine, hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents. Defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the non-decay phenomenon: Alexander, in their view, only appeared to die on June 11th; he actually entered a deep coma. He may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Doherty’s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at Ptolemy as its lead suspect. Ptolemy got the best post-Alexander assignment of any of the leading generals, a posting in wealthy Egypt. He eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries, until finally lost by his descendant Cleopatra in 30 BC. Doherty argues backward from Ptolemy’s later success, reasoning that he who gained the most from Alexander’s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about. It is the same thinking that Oliver Stone used when he made Ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in <em>Alexander</em>. As the director said in the Berkeley interview: ‘I go back to [the film] <em>JFK</em>: <em>Cui bono</em>? Who benefits?’</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is startling to think that Ptolemy or Rhoxane, two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to Alexander, may have wanted him dead, but those possibilities cannot be ruled out. Neither can Stone’s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in Alexander’s murder, at least by not intervening to prevent it (‘By silence we consented’). Indeed John Atkinson, a South African classicist, has put forward a scenario very much like that of Stone’s film in a 2009 journal article entitled ‘Alexander’s Last Days: Malaria and Mind Games?’ (co-authored with two medical specialists, Elsie and Etienne Truter).</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like Stone, Atkinson portrays an Alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates. ‘The officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap’, he and his co-authors write. ‘Men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger.’ In Atkinson’s view the campaigns Alexander had in mind in June 323 BC – including conquest of Arabia, Carthage and the entire Mediterranean coast – were a bridge too far for Alexander’s officers. Having turned him back from the East by mutiny, he argues, these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the West.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even while regarding Alexander as a pariah to his own people, Atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned, seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms. His verdict is something closer to euthanasia: after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the ‘mind games’ of the article’s title. ‘The officers in Alexander’s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive’, Atkinson writes. ‘Maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die.’</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions. Ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever, even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios. Mayor and Hayes raise the possibility that Alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered; John Grieve suspects he was poisoned, but by accident. Atkinson makes the case that Alexander’s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural, but something in between.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the embalmed body of Alexander is ever found – and some researchers continue to hunt for it – we may finally learn what caused his death, but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century AD (it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at Alexandria). Meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Justin and Quintus Curtius. Unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the Alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories. Opponents of such theories have long noted that Alexander himself, during the 10 or 12 days he slid towards death, never gave any sign that he suspected poison, though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years. He would never have gone willingly to his death (as Oliver Stone’s film appears to imply), nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him. A slow decline would allow him to order their executions. To assert that Alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The same point could be made about what followed Alexander’s death. The chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination. If the goal of the generals was to ‘go home and spend their dough’, as Oliver Stone asserted in his Berkeley interview, they failed miserably. None ever returned to Macedonia and only Ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security. Many of the others continued fighting and killing each other. Given how central Alexander was to the stability of their world, they had no reason in June 323 BC to expect otherwise.</p>\n",
            "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Any plan to poison Alexander would have been fraught with perils, especially for Macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins. Conspiracy theories have to assume that Alexander’s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything. It is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them: as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king. Thus it is easier, in the end, to believe that Alexander died of disease, despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise.</p>\n",

              "[['In his article, James Romm explores the enduring mystery surrounding the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, an event that has baffled historians and sparked numerous theories over the centuries. Despite his robust health and seemingly divine status, Alexander’s sudden death at 32 in Babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership, plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the Wars of the Successors. While some historians suggest natural causes like disease, others propose theories of murder, fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death. Oliver Stone’s film Alexander reignited interest in these theories, suggesting a conspiracy among Alexander’s generals. Various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians. Despite extensive historical, forensic, and toxicological research, including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with Alexander’s symptoms, the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation, leaving one of history’s greatest mysteries unsolved.',\n",
              "  'by James Romm',\n",
              "  'In Babylon on June 11th, 323 BC, at about 5pm, Alexander the Great died aged 32, having conquered an empire stretching from modern Albania to eastern Pakistan. The question of what, or who, killed the Macedonian king has never been answered successfully. Today new theories are heating up one of history’s longest-running cold cases.',\n",
              "  'Like the death of Stalin, to which it is sometimes compared, the death of Alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible. Conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king’s body was cold, but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects. Fuel was added to the fire by Oliver Stone‘s Alexander, released in 2004 with new versions in 2006 and 2008: a film that, whatever its artistic flaws, presents a historically informed theory about who killed Alexander and why.',\n",
              "  'Few events have been as unexpected as the death of Alexander. The king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his 12-year campaign through Asia, enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles. Some had come to think of him as divine, an idea fostered, and perhaps entertained, by Alexander himself. In 325, fighting almost single-handed against South Asian warriors, Alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow, yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches, a 60-day trek along the barren coast of southern Iran.',\n",
              "  'Consequently, when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later, the shock felt by his 50,000-strong army was intense. So was the confusion about who would next lead it, for Alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir (though one would be born shortly after his death). The sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point, the start of a half-century of instability and strife known today as the Wars of the Successors.',\n",
              "  'Events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes. It is disturbing to think that blind chance – a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito – put the ancient world on a perilous new course. An explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring, even though it involves a darker view of Alexander’s relations with his Companions, the inner circle of friends and high-ranking officers that surrounded him in Babylon.',\n",
              "  'Ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of Alexander’s death, though many attribute it to disease. In 1996 Eugene Borza, a scholar specialising in ancient Macedon, took part in a medical board of inquiry at the University of Maryland, which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever; Borza has since defended that finding in print. Malaria, smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed, with alcoholism, infection from the lung wound and grief – Alexander’s close friend Hephaestion had died some months earlier – often seen as complicating factors. But some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness, or even to choose between illness or murder: two Alexander experts who once made this choice (one on each side) later changed their opinions to undecided.',\n",
              "  'With historical research at an impasse, Alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches. Armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology, they are re-opening the Alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation.',\n",
              "  'The idea that Alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in 2004, thanks to the ending of Stone’s film. In its epilogue Alexander’s senior general Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins), looking back over decades at his commander’s death, declares: ‘The truth is, we did kill him. By silence, we consented … Because we couldn’t go on.’ Ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again. ‘You shall write: He died of disease, and in weakened condition.’',\n",
              "  'The idea that Alexander’s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of Stone’s famously plot-prone imagination. There is some evidence that not even Alexander’s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere. In India in 325 BC, at the eastern edge of the Indus river system, Alexander’s army staged a sit-down strike, when ordered to march eastward towards the Ganges. Even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny. Stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy, since Alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death. ‘I can’t believe that these men were going on with Alexander’ to Arabia and Carthage, he said in a 2008 interview at the University of California, Berkeley.',\n",
              "  'Stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that Ptolemy masterminded a cover-up of Alexander’s murder, but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed. The account Ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of Alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the Royal Journals. Though now lost it was summarised (in different versions) by Arrian and Plutarch, two Greek writers of the Roman Empire, who endorsed it as the most reliable record of Alexander’s last days. Some scholars, led by the Australian classicist Brian Bosworth, believe the Royal Journals were falsified to make Alexander’s death appear natural, just as Stone’s film represents (though in Bosworth’s view the culprit was Eumenes, Alexander’s court secretary, rather than Ptolemy). Others disagree, taking the Journals to be just what Arrian and Plutarch thought they were, an undoctored, day-by-day eyewitness account.',\n",

              "  '* * *',\n",
              "  'The debate over the Royal Journals has huge implications for our understanding of Alexander’s death, because Arrian and Plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources. Both authors say that Alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named Medius. His fever grew worse over the course of 10 or 12 days (the two accounts differ in chronology), leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak. As his troops shuffled past his sickbed, Arrian reports, Alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one. Death followed the next day.',\n",
              "  'But a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that Stone followed in Alexander. In this alternate version Alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and, more importantly, just as he drained a huge cup of wine. These accounts say that Alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud. From that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms, including great pain, convulsions and delirium, but they say little or nothing about fever, the keynote of the Plutarch and Arrian accounts.',\n",
              "  'A stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison, which is why Plutarch, in his biography of Alexander, vehemently denied that it had occurred. ‘Some writers think they have to say such things, as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama’, he sneered. Apparently the dispute between those who thought Alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder – essentially, those who did or did not trust the Royal Journals – was already rife in Plutarch’s day. Probably all reports of Alexander’s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely.',\n",
              "  'For supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is, of course, ‘whodunnit?’ Stone’s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question. In the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the Companions to show that they know Alexander’s cup contains poison, but no clue is given as to how it got there. By contrast many Greek and Roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it, but how and with what poison. With remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at Antipater, the senior general whom Alexander had left in charge of the Macedonian homeland, and at two of his sons, Cassander and Iollas.',\n",
              "  'Antipater may indeed have had reason to want Alexander dead in the spring of 323 BC, for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to Babylon, perhaps with hostile intent. Antipater stayed put but sent Cassander in his stead. According to several ancient accounts Antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water, collected from the legendary river Styx (believed to flow above ground in the northern Peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld). The water had to be transported in a hollowed-out mule’s hoof, for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn. In Babylon, ran the story, Cassander passed this mule’s hoof to his brother Iollas – conveniently enough, Alexander’s wine-pourer – who then slipped the toxin into the king’s drink.',\n",
              "  'The basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling, but details vary. Some versions mention the philosopher Aristotle as a co-conspirator; he was a known friend of Antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student Alexander, who had sanctioned the death of his relative Callisthenes. Others make Medius, the host of the final, fatal dinner party and allegedly Iollas’ male lover, a participant in the plot. One very early version, published in an anonymous Greek pamphlet, now known as The Last Days and Testament of Alexander, made Iollas doubly guilty: when the first draught of poison failed to kill Alexander, Iollas administered a second, soaking in Styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit.',\n",
              "  'Until recently historians dismissed the story of the Styx water-poisoning as a fiction, possibly a political smear designed to harm Antipater and Cassander. Both were contestants for power in the era after Alexander’s death and had many enemies, especially Olympias, Alexander’s vengeful mother (who, perhaps to help foster the idea of Antipater’s family’s guilt, eventually had Iollas’ grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind). Even the idea that ordinary Greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd. In 1913 the distinguished classicist J.G. Frazer declared that the waters the Greeks identified as the Styx, today called Blackwater or Mavroneri, contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century.',\n",
              "  'But, in a presentation at a conference in Barcelona in 2010, the historian Adrienne Mayor and the toxicologist Antoinette Hayes proposed that the limestone around Mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin. Chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today (though they may have disappeared over the centuries). Mayor and Hayes argue that ‘calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for Alexander’ – including his high fever, usually seen as proof of a natural death.',\n",
              "  'The research of Mayor and Hayes might suggest that Alexander was murdered, though the authors themselves stop short of that claim. They are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself. Their thesis that the Styx really was strongly toxic would account for why Antipater and his sons were the ancient world’s prime suspects: Cassander’s journey from Europe to Babylon just a few weeks before the onset of Alexander’s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which Styx water could have arrived at the king’s banquet table. (Cassander later helped confirm the ancient world’s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of Macedonia and executing Alexander’s mother, wife and son.)',\n",
              "  'The authors are also interested in how, in the Greek imagination, the mythic resonance of the Styx, a river thought able to stupefy even the gods, made it an ideal weapon for Antipater and his sons to use. ‘Such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to Alexander’, Mayor said recently. ‘An ordinary, common drug would not do. Only a very rare, potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for Alexander.’',\n",
              "  'It remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of Antipater’s conspiracy can help crack the mystery. But it is clear that the Mayor-Hayes approach, matching toxins available to the ancient world with Alexander’s reported symptoms, has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery. Three other investigators have pursued it in recent years, combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin: Ptolemy, one of Alexander’s leading generals, committed the murder with arsenic; Rhoxane, the king’s wife, did it with strychnine; Alexander’s physicians did it, but by accident, with powdered hellebore root.',\n",
              "  'The last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the New Zealand toxicologist Leo Schep and the Scotland Yard detective John Grieve. These two men were brought together in a 2009 television documentary, Alexander the Great’s Mysterious Death. Schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore, used medicinally by the ancient Greeks but lethal in large doses, could best account for Alexander’s recorded symptoms. Grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin, as Schep had supposed, but by Alexander’s doctors, who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him.',\n",
              "  'Grieve’s ingenious speculation is only that, but has already won the endorsement of at least one Alexander specialist, the British classicist Richard Stoneman. ‘Hellebore, despite its dangers, was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects’, Stoneman notes. ‘But it was easy to get the dose wrong, and Alexander’s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in Babylon – or even misread the Babylonian label.’',\n",
              "  'But the toxicology on which Schep and Grieve rely is evidently not an exact science, especially when practiced at a distance of 2,300 years. The author Graham Phillips submitted the same record of Alexander’s symptoms as Schep’s to the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Center but obtained a very different answer. In his 2004 book Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon Phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like Alexander’s.',\n",
              "  'Following a twisting, at times tortuous, trail of logic Phillips tries to identify Alexander’s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine. The poisonous plant is rare along Alexander’s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent (modern Pakistan). Not all of Alexander’s retinue followed him into such areas, allowing Phillips to eliminate potential suspects. He concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill Alexander also had the means: Rhoxane, the first of the king’s three wives. She had become enraged at Alexander, Phillips assumes, by his two subsequent marriages to Persian princesses and killed him. This view of Rhoxane as a latter-day Medea revives one popularised in the 17th-century English tragedy by Nataniel Lee, The Rival Queens, but is not supported by evidence. (Oliver Stone, too, portrays Rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman, though he makes her guilty of the death of Hephaestion – in his view, Alexander’s male lover – rather than Alexander himself.)',\n",
              "  'Arsenic gets the spotlight in a 2004 book, The Death of Alexander the Great by Paul Doherty, novelist and amateur historian. Doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by Plutarch and the Roman writer Quintus Curtius: Alexander’s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of Babylon for a week or more. Doherty cites toxicology studies of the 19th century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification. However the jury seems to be out on this point and, for obvious reasons, opportunities for field tests are few.',\n",
              "  'If Alexander’s body really did resist decomposition – and some experts consider the story a fiction – then numerous explanations have to be considered. Those who believe Alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol. Strychnine, hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents. Defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the non-decay phenomenon: Alexander, in their view, only appeared to die on June 11th; he actually entered a deep coma. He may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him.',\n",
              "  'Doherty’s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at Ptolemy as its lead suspect. Ptolemy got the best post-Alexander assignment of any of the leading generals, a posting in wealthy Egypt. He eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries, until finally lost by his descendant Cleopatra in 30 BC. Doherty argues backward from Ptolemy’s later success, reasoning that he who gained the most from Alexander’s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about. It is the same thinking that Oliver Stone used when he made Ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in Alexander. As the director said in the Berkeley interview: ‘I go back to [the film] JFK: Cui bono? Who benefits?’',\n",
              "  'It is startling to think that Ptolemy or Rhoxane, two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to Alexander, may have wanted him dead, but those possibilities cannot be ruled out. Neither can Stone’s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in Alexander’s murder, at least by not intervening to prevent it (‘By silence we consented’). Indeed John Atkinson, a South African classicist, has put forward a scenario very much like that of Stone’s film in a 2009 journal article entitled ‘Alexander’s Last Days: Malaria and Mind Games?’ (co-authored with two medical specialists, Elsie and Etienne Truter).',\n",
              "  'Like Stone, Atkinson portrays an Alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates. ‘The officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap’, he and his co-authors write. ‘Men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger.’ In Atkinson’s view the campaigns Alexander had in mind in June 323 BC – including conquest of Arabia, Carthage and the entire Mediterranean coast – were a bridge too far for Alexander’s officers. Having turned him back from the East by mutiny, he argues, these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the West.',\n",
              "  'Even while regarding Alexander as a pariah to his own people, Atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned, seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms. His verdict is something closer to euthanasia: after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the ‘mind games’ of the article’s title. ‘The officers in Alexander’s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive’, Atkinson writes. ‘Maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die.’',\n",
              "  'And so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions. Ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever, even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios. Mayor and Hayes raise the possibility that Alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered; John Grieve suspects he was poisoned, but by accident. Atkinson makes the case that Alexander’s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural, but something in between.',\n",
              "  'If the embalmed body of Alexander is ever found – and some researchers continue to hunt for it – we may finally learn what caused his death, but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century AD (it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at Alexandria). Meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Justin and Quintus Curtius. Unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots.',\n",
              "  'With physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the Alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories. Opponents of such theories have long noted that Alexander himself, during the 10 or 12 days he slid towards death, never gave any sign that he suspected poison, though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years. He would never have gone willingly to his death (as Oliver Stone’s film appears to imply), nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him. A slow decline would allow him to order their executions. To assert that Alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled.',\n",
              "  'The same point could be made about what followed Alexander’s death. The chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination. If the goal of the generals was to ‘go home and spend their dough’, as Oliver Stone asserted in his Berkeley interview, they failed miserably. None ever returned to Macedonia and only Ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security. Many of the others continued fighting and killing each other. Given how central Alexander was to the stability of their world, they had no reason in June 323 BC to expect otherwise.',\n",
              "  'Any plan to poison Alexander would have been fraught with perils, especially for Macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins. Conspiracy theories have to assume that Alexander’s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything. It is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them: as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king. Thus it is easier, in the end, to believe that Alexander died of disease, despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise.',\n",

              "  'From an artillery officer to a general, then king, and finally emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte was everything: a military genius, politician, jurist, and creative talent supported by unparalleled dynamism. He lent his name to ambition and did so in a minimal amount of time. In the handful of years between Austerlitz and Waterloo, he took the world. When defeated, he had marked it forever. Then, from the exile of Saint Helena, he soared into legend. It all began on another island, Corsica, where the future general was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio to a family of ancient and noble Tuscan origins: his father Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, a lawyer, and his mother Maria Letizia Ramolino, a descendant of a wealthy Italian family. At ten, a scholarship opened the doors to the exclusive military school of Brienne-le-Château in northern France, where the offspring of high lineage learned the art of war. It was five years of study and reading, and also of taunts: his classmates didn’t forgive his Corsican origin and his halting French. Napoleon emerged with a quarrelsome and solitary disposition and a strong spirit of revenge, pride bolstered by a bitter anti-French resentment. His military career progressed rapidly: in 1784, he moved to the Royal School of Paris, and at just sixteen years old, he was assigned to an artillery regiment stationed at La Fère in Picardy. When the revolution broke out in 1789, Napoleon joined and obtained a leave to return to Corsica, hoping the new upheavals could benefit the island’s cause. However, he had to flee in 1793 with his family after breaking with the independence front.',\n",
              "  'In Paris, the revolution had already led to the Reign of Terror, and the guillotine was in full swing. Appointed captain, he was sent by the Committee of Public Health to suppress dissent in Marseille, later taking command of the troops in Toulon, where monarchists, supported by the English, had entrenched themselves. The young officer brilliantly resolved the city’s siege, exhibiting artillery force management that already revealed the genius strategist. A success that earned him the rank of brigade general and the attention of future Directory member Paul Barras, who two years later, on October 5, 1795, appointed him commander of the Paris garrison: Napoleon saved the National Convention by quelling the royalist uprising in blood. He was named general of the Army Corps of the Interior: at only 26 years old, he was a rapidly rising star.',\n",
              "  'Marriage to Josephine and the Italian Triumphs',\n",
              "  'In the Capital, the young Corsican met the high society: he went to the theater, organized dinners, and stepped into the influential salons. He was captivated by the charm of Josephine Tasher, widow Beauharnais, a great lady with a thousand connections, older than him, in debt, but still the owner of a rich income. She bet on the magnetic-eyed soldier; he on a refined woman capable of polishing his manners. On March 9, 1796, he married her and, on the 27th of the same month, was already in Nice commanding the Army of Italy, ready to battle Austria, the leader of the coalition among the major European monarchies terrified by the specter of the “revolutionary plague.” The campaign began on April 12; on May 14, Napoleon entered Milan as a conqueror. In just over a month, the young military man, having delivered to legend, took everyone by surprise by attacking from Liguria, dividing the enemy front, and routing first the Piedmontese and then the Austrians of the old general Beaulieu, literally at the mercy of the rival’s strategic choices. Leading an exhausted, poorly paid, scarcely equipped, outnumbered army, Napoleon accomplished his first masterpiece, built on the innovative management of troops, meticulous preparation of battles, selection of officers as courageous and bold as him, and the ability to revitalize the army by instilling a common sentiment that becomes a shared dream of glory when the bond between troop and leader solidifies into fanatic devotion to the commander.',\n",
              "  'In Italy, Napoleon discovered he had greatness equal to his ambition. And he began to serve both. On August 5 at Castiglione delle Stiviere, he won his first major field battle, pushing to Venice and forcing Austria to the Treaty of Campoformio. Crowned with the laurel of the victor, he became politically cumbersome in France. The Directory preferred to distance him from Paris by entrusting him with the occupation of Egypt, aimed at countering British economic interests in the seas. The campaign was a failure: despite the victorious Battle of the Pyramids fought on July 21, 1798, the commander had to witness the complete destruction of the fleet by the hands of English Admiral Horatio Nelson and surrender to the impossibility of taking the ancient Crusader fortress of Saint John of Acre.',\n",
              "  'Returning home, he found the Directory in crisis and the army in tatters. There was no choice but a coup. On November 9, 1799 (according to the revolutionary calendar, 18 Brumaire), Bonaparte dissolved the Chambers, power passed to three consuls who introduced a new constitution, then ratified by a plebiscite. Appointed First Consul, the general had the country in his hands and shaped it on a model of strong administrative centralization: the country was divided into departments with the new figure of the prefect at the helm. He also resolved the long-standing dispute with the Church, signing the concordat that established the state’s secularity. He founded the National Bank and reorganized the educational system, including the lycée, the forge of the new ruling class.',\n",
              "  'But if France was his, Italy was slipping away. The second anti-French coalition had overturned some of the republics born from the first expedition, so the First Consul returned to war and victory, first at Montebello and then at Marengo, on June 14, 1800. From the triumph was born, in 1802, the Italian Republic, of which Bonaparte became president, while the Treaty of Amiens signed with the United Kingdom granted two years of respite to Europe. At Notre-Dame, in 1804, Napoleon received from Pope Pius VII the crown of French emperor; the following year in Milan, in the Duomo, he placed the Iron Crown of King of Italy on his head.',\n",
              "  'French Emperor and King of Italy',\n",
              "  'At the height of glory and power, he targeted England. But the planned invasion of the island clashed with the disproportion of naval forces and foundered after the annihilation of the fleet at Trafalgar by Nelson. In 1805, Napoleon faced the third anti-French coalition, which this time involved England, Austria, and Russia, sending his most valiant marshal, Andrea Massena, to “disturb” the Austrians in Italy, while he personally took command of the “Grande Armée.” It was the eve of Austerlitz, Bonaparte’s strategic masterpiece: on December 3, 1805, on the anniversary of his coronation, he defeated the Austro-Russians. The following year he also defeated Frederick William II’s Prussia at Jena and made his triumphant entrance into Berlin. In 1807 at Friedland, the army of Tsar Alexander capitulated. Practically unbeatable, leading an army drunk with success, the emperor now imposed the Continental Blockade, forbidding ships flying the English flag from docking at any port, thus hoping to bend the British economy. To the pope who refused to adhere, he responded with the capture of Rome and the annexation of the Papal States to the empire, and when the excommunication bull arrived, he had the pontiff arrested, who was then transferred to France, first to Grenoble and then to Fontainebleau.',\n",
              "  'The blockade, however, was a failure. Too many states circumvented it, including Portugal, which was invaded in retaliation. Napoleon then took advantage of the dynastic dispute between Charles IV and his son to force both to abdicate and place his brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, without, however, managing to tame the guerrillas or even to annihilate the English expeditionary force that in the meantime had liberated the Lusitanian state. Despite the difficulties, in 1809 he also bent the fifth coalition (yet another alliance between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom), defeated from a position of undisputed military superiority. He occupied Vienna and the Schönbrunn Castle and dictated a harsh peace to the Austrians. Meanwhile, he agreed with their prime minister Metternich on a state marriage capable of definitively reconciling France and Austria and, hopefully, of granting the emperor the longed-for male heir. He had divorced Josephine, his beloved but unfaithful companion, and now married Maria Luisa of Austria, niece of Marie Antoinette. But the son born in 1811, Napoleon Francis, known as the King of Rome, would never ascend the throne and would die at just 21 years old.',\n",
              "  'Determined to strike a final blow against Tsar Alexander, the Emperor attempted the invasion of Russia, a titanic endeavor that ended in an epochal defeat. The numbers don’t lie: the Emperor set off at the head of an army of 700,000 men, of which over 400,000 would never return. The defeat gave rise to the European powers. Napoleon, back in France, worked night and day to rebuild the army, about 400,000 strong, largely young recruits. The wounded old lion was enough to keep the Prussians at bay, but not the bulk of the coalition, including the Austrians, who did not seem to greatly respect the previous year’s marriage. The French army capitulated at Leipzig. Napoleon entrusted the regency to his wife and the capital to his brother, then took the lead of 60,000 veterans and for two months kept the enemy forces at bay, eventually yielding to the Prussians. On March 31, 1813, Tsar Alexander entered Paris. Napoleon was forced to abdicate. After an attempted suicide with arsenic, miraculously thwarted, and a moving farewell to the Old Guard, he reached Marseille and sailed for his exile on Elba. On the island, he vented his hyperactivity by building roads and infrastructure and kept a watchful eye on Paris where Louis XVIII, back on the throne after his abdication, had already alienated the favor of the people.',\n",

              "  'Ten months of confinement were enough. He escaped British surveillance and on March 1, 1815, landed at Antibes: the legendary ‘Hundred Days’ began. Marching towards Paris, he raised unexpected popular enthusiasm: his mere appearance was enough to persuade the troops sent against him by the king to mutiny. Back on the throne, he reorganized the army and promulgated a more liberal constitution. The final duel awaited him. He faced his usual enemies, with the United Kingdom and Prussia at the forefront. He still planned to divide the predominant opposing forces, but the maneuver only partially succeeded. Waterloo would be the last chapter of the inimitable military history of the fabulous Corsican. Tactical and organizational errors would decree the historic defeat of June 18, 1815, also weighed down by the choice of generals not up to the task. Having found refuge in the Château de Malmaison, Napoleon awaited his fate: on July 15, he surrendered to the British. Convinced he could live as a private citizen in England or the United States, he instead faced life imprisonment on the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. On that speck of land, closely watched by a British contingent, the man who had been master of Europe died on May 5, 1821, at 17:49, struck down by stomach cancer. Buried on the island, his body was only returned to Paris for a solemn funeral in 1840. Since 1861, he rests in a monumental tomb in the Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides.',\n",
              "  'THE GREATEST LEGACY: THE NAPOLEONIC CODE\\nDuring his exile on the Island of Saint Helena, following the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon often emphasized that his most important work, the one that would go down in history more than his military victories, would be the Napoleonic Code. He was right. Promulgated in 36 laws on March 21, 1804 – followed by the Code of Civil Procedure in 1806 and the Commercial Code in 1807 – it was the first modern civil code, of which Napoleon was not only the inspirer and promoter but also shared in its drafting, entrusted to four great jurists. It is thanks to Napoleon, who lacked legal knowledge, that the Code is noted for its particular clarity. Still in force in France and Belgium, and a model for the Italian and Spanish codes, the Napoleonic Code confirmed the major achievements of the French Revolution, while distancing itself from the excesses of the legislation from 1789-1804: legal equality before the law, religious freedom, the right to private property, and the secularism of the state, putting an end to the legacies of the Ancien Régime, feudalism, absolutism, creating a predominantly bourgeois society.',\n",

              "  'Da ufficiale d’artiglieria a generale, poi re e infine imperatore. Napoleone Bonaparte è stato tutto: genio militare, politico, giurista, talento creativo sostenuto da un dinamismo senza pari. Ha dato il suo nome all’ambizione e lo ha fatto in un tempo minimo. In quel pugno di anni che separano Austerlitz da Waterloo si è preso il mondo. Quando, sconfìtto, lo ha restituito, la sua impronta l’aveva segnato per sempre. Poi dall’esilio di Sant’Elena ha spiccato il volo nella leggenda. Tutto era cominciato su un’altra isola, la Corsica, dove il futuro generale nasce il 15 agosto 1769 ad Ajaccio da una famiglia di antiche e nobili origini toscane: il padre Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, avvocato, la madre Maria Letizia Ramolino, discendente di un’agiata casata italiana. A dieci anni una borsa di studio gli spalanca le porte dell’esclusiva scuola militare di Brienne-le-Château, nord della Francia, dove imparano l’arte della guerra i pargoli di alto lignaggio. Sarà un lustro di studio e letture, e anche di sberleffi: i compagni non gli perdonano l’origine corsa e quel francese zoppicante. Napoleone ne uscirà con una disposizione d’animo scontrosa e solitaria e un forte spirito di rivalsa, l’orgoglio rafforzato da un acre risentimento antifrancese. La carriera militare procede spedita: nel 1784 passa alla Regia scuola di Parigi e a soli sedici anni viene assegnato ad un reggimento di artiglieria di stanza a La Fère, in Piccardia. Quando scoppia la rivoluzione, nel 1789, Napoleone aderisce e ottiene una licenza per tornare in Corsica, sperando che i nuovi fermenti possano giovare alla causa dell’isola. Dovrà invece fuggire nel 1793 con tutta la famiglia dopo aver rotto con il fronte indipendentista.',\n",
              "  'A Parigi la rivoluzione è già sfociata nel Terrore, la ghigliottina lavora a pieno regime. Nominato capitano, viene inviato dal Comitato di Salute Pubblica a reprimere il dissenso a Marsiglia, in seguito prenderà il comando delle truppe a Tolone, dove i monarchici, sostenuti dagli inglesi, si sono trincerati. Il giovane ufficiale risolve brillantemente l’assedio della città, esibendo una gestione delle forze d’artiglieria che già rivela il geniale stratega. Un successo che gli vale la nomina a generale di brigata e l’attenzione del futuro membro del Direttorio Paul Barras, che due anni dopo, il 5 ottobre 1795, lo nomina comandante della piazza di Parigi: Napoleone salva la Convenzione nazionale soffocando nel sangue la rivolta monarchica. Arriva la nomina a generale del Corpo d’armata dell’Interno: a soli 26 anni è una stella in rapida ascesa.',\n",

Rimane stregato dal fascino di Giuseppina Tasher, vedova Beauharnais, gran signora dalle mille relazioni, più grande di lui, indebitata, ma pur sempre titolare di una ricca rendita: lei scommette su quel militare dallo sguardo magnetico, lui su una donna raffinata in grado di ripulirne modi e maniere. Il 9 marzo 1796 la sposa e il 27 dello stesso mese è già a Nizza al comando dell’Armata d’Italia pronta a dar battaglia all’Austria, capofila della coalizione tra le maggiori monarchie europee terrorizzate dallo spettro della “peste rivoluzionaria”. La campagna comincia il 12 aprile; il 14 maggio Napoleone entra da trionfatore a Milano. In poco più di un mese, consegnato alla leggenda, il giovane militare ha spiazzato tutti attaccando dalla Liguria, diviso il fronte nemico e sbaragliato prima i piemontesi e poi gli austriaci del vecchio generale Beaulieu, letteralmente in balia delle scelte strategiche del rivale. A capo di un esercito infiacchito, mal pagato, scarsamente equipaggiato, inferiore di numero, Napoleone ha compiuto il suo primo capolavoro, costruito sulla gestione innovativa delle truppe, la meticolosa preparazione degli scontri, la scelta di ufficiali coraggiosi e spavaldi quanto lui, la capacità di rivitalizzare l’esercito consegnando agli uomini un comune sentire che diventa sogno di gloria condiviso quando il rapporto tra truppa e condottiero si salda al punto da diventare devozione fanatica al condottiero.',\n",

Il 5 agosto a Castiglione delle Stiviere vince la sua prima grande battaglia campale spingendosi fino a Venezia e costringendo l’Austria al trattato di Campoformio. Cinto dall’alloro del trionfatore, in Francia diventa politicamente ingombrante. Il Direttorio preferisce allontanarlo da Parigi affidandogli l’occupazione dell’Egitto, volta a contrastare gli interessi economici inglesi sui mari. La campagna sarà un fallimento: nonostante la vittoriosa battaglia delle Piramidi combattuta il 21 luglio 1798, il condottiero dovrà assistere alla completa distruzione della flotta per mano dell’ammiraglio inglese Horatio Nelson e arrendersi all’impossibilità di prendere l’antica fortezza crociata di San Giovanni d’Acri.',\n",

Il 9 novembre 1799 (secondo il calendario rivoluzionario, 18 brumaio) Bonaparte fa sciogliere le Camere, il potere passa a tre consoli che varano una nuova costituzione, poi ratificata da un plebiscito. Fattosi nominare Primo Console, il generale ha in mano il Paese e lo modella sul modello di un forte accentramento amministrativo: il Paese viene diviso in dipartimenti con a capo la nuova figura del prefetto. Chiude anche l’annoso contenzioso con la Chiesa, siglando il concordato che sancisce la laicità dello Stato.

La seconda coalizione antifrancese ha rovesciato parte delle repubbliche figlie della prima spedizione, così il Primo Console torna alla guerra e alla vittoria, prima a Montebello e poi a Marengo, il 14 giugno 1800. Dal trionfo nasce, nel 1802, la Repubblica italiana di cui Bonaparte diviene presidente, mentre il trattato di Amiens stipulato con il Regno Unito regala due anni di tregua all’Europa. A Notre-Dame, nel 1804, Napoleone riceve da papa Pio VII la corona di imperatore francese; l’anno dopo a Milano, in Duomo, cinge quella Ferrea di re d’Italia.',\n",

Ma la progettata invasione dell’isola si scontra con la sproporzione delle forze navali e naufraga dopo l’annientamento, a Trafalgar, della flotta a opera ancora di Nelson. Nel 1805 Napoleone fronteggia quindi la terza coalizione antifrancese che stavolta vede impegnate Inghilterra, Austria e Russia, spedendo il suo più valente maresciallo, Andrea Massena, a “disturbare” gli austriaci in Italia, mentre in persona assume il comando della “Grande Armata”. È la vigilia di Austerlitz, capolavoro strategico di Bonaparte: il 3 dicembre 1805, nell’anniversario della sua incoronazione, sbaraglia gli austro-russi. L’anno seguente sconfìgge anche la Prussia di Federico Guglielmo II a Jena e fa il suo trionfale ingresso a Berlino. Nel 1807 a Friedland capitola l’esercito dello zar Alessandro. Praticamente imbattibile, alla testa di un’armata ebbra di successi, l’imperatore impone ora il blocco continentale, vietando alle navi battenti bandiera inglese l’attracco in qualsiasi porto, auspicando così di piegare l’economia britannica. Al papa che rifiuta di aderirvi risponde con la presa di Roma e l’annessione dello Stato pontificio all’impero e quando arriva la bolla di scomunica fa arrestare il pontefice che verrà trasferito in Francia, prima a Grenoble e poi a Fontainebleau.',\n",
              "  'Il blocco è però un insuccesso. Troppi gli Stati che lo aggirano, fra questi il Portogallo che per rappresaglia viene invaso. In seguito Napoleone approfitta della disputa dinastica tra Carlo IV e il figlio per costringere entrambi ad abdicare e porre sul trono di Spagna il fratello Giuseppe, senza però riuscire a domare la guerriglia e nemmeno ad annientare il corpo di spedizione inglese che nel frattempo ha liberato lo Stato lusitano. Nonostante le difficoltà, nel 1809 piega anche la quinta coalizione (ennesima alleanza fra Impero austriaco e Regno Unito), sconfitta dall’alto di una indiscussa superiorità militare. Occupa Vienna e il castello di Schönbrunn e detta agli austriaci una pace durissima. Intanto si accorda con il loro primo ministro Metternich per un matrimonio di stato in grado di conciliare definitivamente Francia e Austria e, sperabilmente, di regalare all’imperatore l’agognato erede maschio. Aveva divorziato da Giuseppina, adorata ma infedele compagna, ora impalma Maria Luisa d’Austria, nipote di Maria Antonietta. Ma il figlio che nasce nel 1811, Napoleone Francesco, detto il re di Roma, non salirà mai sul trono e morirà a soli 21 anni.',\n",

I numeri non mentono: l’imperatore parte alla testa di un esercito di 700 mila uomini dei quali oltre 400 mila non faranno mai ritorno. La disfatta fa rialzare la testa alle potenze europee. Napoleone rientrato in Francia lavora notte e giorno a rimettere in piedi l’esercito, circa 400 mila effettivi, in gran parte giovani reclute. Al vecchio leone ferito bastano per tenere a bada i prussiani ma non il grosso della coalizione, compresi gli austriaci che non sembrano tenere in gran conto il matrimonio dell’anno precedente. L’esercito francese capitola a Lipsia. Napoleone affida la reggenza alla moglie e la capitale al fratello, quindi si mette alla testa di 60 mila veterani e per due mesi tiene a bada le forze nemiche, dovendo poi cedere ai prussiani. Il 31 marzo 1813 lo zar Alessandro entra a Parigi. Napoleone è costretto ad abdicare. Dopo un tentativo di suicidio con l’arsenico, miracolosamente sventato, e un commovente addio alla Vecchia Guardia, raggiunge Marsiglia e salpa per il suo confino all’Elba. Sull’isola sfoga il suo iperattivismo costruendo strade e infrastrutture e tiene un occhio vigile su Parigi dove Luigi XVIII, tornato sul trono dopo la sua abdicazione, si è già alienato i favori del popolo.',\n",

Di nuovo sul trono, riorganizza l’esercito e promulga una costituzione più liberale. Lo aspetta il duello finale. Di fronte ha i nemici di sempre, Regno Unito e Prussia in prima fila. Progetta ancora di dividere le preponderanti forze avversarie, ma la manovra riesce solo parzialmente. Waterloo sarà l’ultimo capitolo dell’inimitabile storia militare del favoloso corso. Errori tattici e organizzativi decreteranno la storica disfatta del 18 giugno 1815, sulla quale pesa anche la scelta di generali non all’altezza. Trovato rifugio nel castello di Malmaison, Napoleone attende il suo destino: il 15 luglio si arrende agli inglesi.

Aveva ragione. Promulgato in 36 leggi il 21 marzo 1804 – seguirono il Codice di procedura civile nel 1806 e il Codice di commercio nel 1807 – fu il primo codice civile moderno, di cui Napoleone non fu solo l’ispiratore e il promotore ma ne condivise la redazione, affidata a quattro grandi giuristi. Si deve proprio a Napoleone, privo di nozioni giuridiche, la particolare chiarezza dell’articolato. Tutt’ora in vigore in Francia e Belgio, e modello per quello italiano e spagnolo, il Codice napoleonico confermava le maggiori conquiste della Rivoluzione Francese, pur distanziandosi dagli eccessi della legislazione del 1789-1804: l’uguaglianza giuridica di fronte alla legge, la libertà religiosa, il diritto di proprietà privata e la laicità dello stato, ponendo fine ai retaggi dell’Ancién regime, del feudalesimo, dell’assolutismo, creando una società prevalentemente borghese.',\n",

On 4 November 1979, the embassy was stormed by Iranian protestors, forcing Lijek, his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by Canada and the CIA.',\n",
              "  'At 9am on Sunday 4 November 1979, Mark Lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of Iranian protestors climbed the gate of the US Embassy in Tehran. The attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between Iran and the US, culminating in what would be one of the modern era’s highest-profile hostage crises. As the embassy fell into Iranian hands, however, Lijek and five others, including his wife, would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country. Their incredible story was retold in the Oscar-winning 2012 film Argo, but here Lijek tells us what really happened.',\n",
              "  'Lijek served as a consular officer for the US Embassy in Tehran, while his wife Cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office. “Most of the Americans worked in two buildings; the vast majority were in the Chancellery, which was in the south centre of the compound, and the rest of us worked in the consular annex, which was about a five-minute walk to the northwest,” explains Lijek. “Our compound was very large, 26 acres [10 hectares] and about a mile [1.6 kilometres] of wall, and we had 13 marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing, so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question. The plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue.”',\n",
              "  'It quickly became apparent, though, that rescue was out of the question. “We had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons, locked everything down, and we basically just sat there,” continues Lijek. “We didn’t see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour. Finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building.',\n",
              "  '“Eventually, somebody noticed our building was not fully protected. It was brand new, we had all these latest security upgrades, but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows. They were just normal glass, no bars, no nothing. So somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in, and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder. He pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below. A friend and I grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together, but if they really wanted to break through they could have, and I’m not sure why we were left alone from that point on, but we sort of were.”',\n",
              "  'It became a very nervous wait for Lijek and his colleagues. The electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait, which they did for two hours. “Finally we were told that we should try to get to the British compound,” says Lijek. “There was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go, but given the circumstances we didn’t have much choice.”',\n",
              "  'The marine opened the door and one of Lijek’s friends crept out, finding three policemen who didn’t have any objections to them leaving. The Iranian customers and\\xa0employees in the building had already made a break to get home, leaving just 13 Americans behind. It was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success; the two married couples, Lijek and his wife being one, left in the first group of six with two civilian Americans who were there on business. “I assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first, and in fact that’s how it turned out,” explains Lijek. ”We made it. That second group that left a few minutes after us did not, with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me, this fella Bob Anders, our immigration chief.”',\n",
              "  'In addition to the embassy swarming with protestors, the streets were alive with revolutionaries. ”I was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us,” says Lijek, “and in fact that’s exactly what happened to that second group of Americans. They followed us but we came to the first major north-south street, and we turned south, which was the proper direction to go to the British compound. The second group, which included our boss, the consular general, decided to go to his house and play bridge instead, so they turned north. And apparently that little change in plan got them caught, because they got about 150 yards [135 metres] north and some guy with a G3 [rifle] came running after them, rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy.”',\n",
              "  'Lijek and his group made their way to the British compound through the narrow city streets, but when they got to Ferdowsi Square, which was right in front of the compound, they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path. Ducking into an alley, they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to Anders’ apartment and wait out the trouble. “You have to remember, we’re still thinking all we’ve got to do is hide out for a few hours, we did not know that there would be no rescue,” says Lijek. “So once we got to Bob’s place we were feeling pretty good. We sat around, had a nice lunch, had a few drinks, listened to the BBC describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and we’d be back at work tomorrow.”',\n",
              "  'By 11pm, four of them, Lijek and his wife and the other couple, Joe and Kathy Stafford, made their way to the Iran-America Society to spend the night. The following day they were on the move again, this time finally to the British compound after a brief stop at the Staffords’ apartment, but all the while an uncooperative Washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were.',\n",
              "  'That Monday, 5 November, the British Embassy (separate from the British compound they were in) was attacked. “The compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in,” says Lijek “Frankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it. So London and Washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you.” Lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again. “As it was, we did feel like we’d been abandoned,” he reveals. Virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee, known as a komiteh, and Lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught.',\n",
              "  'The group were moved to a US Embassy house under the care of a Thai cook called Sam, but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper, an elderly Thai lady, was not comfortable with them being there. After a row between Sam and her on 10 November, she left the house in a foul mood, and the Americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence. Fortunately, Anders had been in contact with his Canadian counterpart, John Sheardown, who insisted they join him at his residence at the Canadian Embassy, which hadn’t been touched by the Iranians.',\n",
              "  'At the Sheardown residence they were able to relax, to an extent. As Americans who had been in the US Embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the Iranians would almost certainly hold them captive, along with the 52 other American hostages. The Canadians were extremely welcoming, however, and Prime Minister Joe Clark sanctioned their stay, unbeknown to the Iranians, of course. They would end up remaining there for two months and, while not uncomfortable, it was not without peril.',\n",
              "  '“In terms of specific threats, one really was John’s gardener,” explains Lijek. “He was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us, and that was kind of a problem because John’s house had a lot of glass walls, and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted. There were other little things, like the garbage; John had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house you’ve got seven [an additional member of the group was added, who had been hiding with the Swedes, while the Staffords were in a residence nearby]. The garbage man was also a member of the komiteh, so John had to start carrying the garbage to work. The other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord, so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days. But we didn’t like going outside, we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons. On one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of Iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road. That was really nice of them but, I mean, it was outside of my comfort zone! It’s not that I expected everybody to know my face or whatever, it’s not like they were putting up wanted posters, but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful.”',\n",
              "  'By January, Lijek’s group was getting restless, so they asked the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor to relay a message to Washington asking for help to leave Iran. But it would not be until late January that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out. The CIA had put together a fake science-fiction movie called Argo, complete with posters, a script and press releases, and the plan was to pretend the group were Hollywood employees out in Tehran shooting a movie.',\n",
              "  '”We didn’t really know anything about the CIA or the specifics of the plan until 26 January when [CIA agent] Tony Mendez and his partner, Julio, came to the house in the evening,” explains Lijek. ”We were briefed on three possible options [for escape]: one of course was the Hollywood scenario, but it was pretty obvious from the way Tony presented them that the other two were throwaways. One, I think, had us as agronomists or something like that, and the other I think we were people involved in a petroleum venture.',\n",
              "  'The Hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility, frankly, because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done? Hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality, it seems, and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime.”',\n",
              "  'Lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan. They were each given roles to play; Lijek was the transportation coordinator for the ‘movie’, his wife the scriptwriter, and so on. They were given new identities, new passports and told to alter their appearance. However, one member of their group, Joe Stafford, did not like the plan at all. “He thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released, which to me made no sense,” says Lijek. Stafford’s refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission.',\n",
              "  'Thankfully, in the morning of 27 January, the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly. Unlike the 2012 movie, their journey to and through the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran was largely uneventful, apart from a brief delay for their plane. There was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed. Indeed, the plan went so well that Lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the Iranians: “What Tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us,” explains Lijek “A professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour, so the thing Tony didn’t want was for us to be nervous, so he needed us to believe in the scenario. We made a game of it, and with the exception of Joe we were having fun.” Aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour, the group ultimately boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich on the morning of Sunday 27 January 1980, finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close.',\n",
              "  '“Once we got out of Iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief,” says Lijek. “We toasted each other and it was an amazing moment. It’s kind of hard to describe, there were just so many different emotions, including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind, but for ourselves it was like magic. I don’t think I’ve ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress, finally it just all of a sudden goes away. It was incredible.”',\n",
              "  'Although they managed to escape relatively trouble free, not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily, and one man who remained uncertain was President Carter, who later said the Argo six’ had just a fifty-fifty chance of successfully leaving Iran. “I’m surprised he would have launched the operation with only a 50 per cent chance of success,” admits Lijek. ”I did ask Tony about that and he denied it, he said he figured we were at least 75-25 in favour, and that’s kind of what I would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in Tehran.',\n",
              "  '“If Tony had told us we had a fifty-fifty chance, I don’t think we would have voted [to go]. One thing I did learn from the [2012 film Argo] was the risk we were running. It didn’t occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a CIA escort, you know we are spies at that point, and so who knows what they would do. That never really occurred to me until the movie came out.”',\n",
              "  'Thankfully, the escape went according to plan, but while Lijek and his group were free in the USA by early 1980, the ordeal was far from over for the 52 other Americans who were still being held hostage in Iran. They would not be freed until a year later, on 20 January 1981, after Iraq invaded and forced Iran to enter negotiations with the US. Had the ‘Argo six’ left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed, on 4 November 1979, it’s almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity.',\n",
              "  'However, they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country, thanks in no small part to the help from Canada, a gesture widely heralded across the United States. Such was Canada’s role alongside the CIA that the rescue of the ‘Argo six’ is now known as the Canadian Caper, and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten.',\n",

              " 'In Babylon on June 11th, 323 BC, at about 5pm, Alexander the Great died aged 32, having conquered an empire stretching from modern Albania to eastern Pakistan. The question of what, or who, killed the Macedonian king has never been answered successfully. Today new theories are heating up one of history’s longest-running cold cases.',\n",
              " 'Like the death of Stalin, to which it is sometimes compared, the death of Alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible. Conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king’s body was cold, but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects. Fuel was added to the fire by Oliver Stone‘s Alexander, released in 2004 with new versions in 2006 and 2008: a film that, whatever its artistic flaws, presents a historically informed theory about who killed Alexander and why.',\n",
              " 'Few events have been as unexpected as the death of Alexander. The king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his 12-year campaign through Asia, enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles. Some had come to think of him as divine, an idea fostered, and perhaps entertained, by Alexander himself. In 325, fighting almost single-handed against South Asian warriors, Alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow, yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches, a 60-day trek along the barren coast of southern Iran.',\n",
              " 'Consequently, when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later, the shock felt by his 50,000-strong army was intense. So was the confusion about who would next lead it, for Alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir (though one would be born shortly after his death). The sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point, the start of a half-century of instability and strife known today as the Wars of the Successors.',\n",
              " 'Events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes. It is disturbing to think that blind chance – a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito – put the ancient world on a perilous new course. An explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring, even though it involves a darker view of Alexander’s relations with his Companions, the inner circle of friends and high-ranking officers that surrounded him in Babylon.',\n",
              " 'Ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of Alexander’s death, though many attribute it to disease. In 1996 Eugene Borza, a scholar specialising in ancient Macedon, took part in a medical board of inquiry at the University of Maryland, which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever; Borza has since defended that finding in print. Malaria, smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed, with alcoholism, infection from the lung wound and grief – Alexander’s close friend Hephaestion had died some months earlier – often seen as complicating factors. But some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness, or even to choose between illness or murder: two Alexander experts who once made this choice (one on each side) later changed their opinions to undecided.',\n",
              " 'With historical research at an impasse, Alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches. Armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology, they are re-opening the Alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation.',\n",
              " 'The idea that Alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in 2004, thanks to the ending of Stone’s film. In its epilogue Alexander’s senior general Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins), looking back over decades at his commander’s death, declares: ‘The truth is, we did kill him. By silence, we consented … Because we couldn’t go on.’ Ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again. ‘You shall write: He died of disease, and in weakened condition.’',\n",
              " 'The idea that Alexander’s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of Stone’s famously plot-prone imagination. There is some evidence that not even Alexander’s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere. In India in 325 BC, at the eastern edge of the Indus river system, Alexander’s army staged a sit-down strike, when ordered to march eastward towards the Ganges. Even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny. Stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy, since Alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death. ‘I can’t believe that these men were going on with Alexander’ to Arabia and Carthage, he said in a 2008 interview at the University of California, Berkeley.',\n",
              " 'Stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that Ptolemy masterminded a cover-up of Alexander’s murder, but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed. The account Ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of Alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the Royal Journals. Though now lost it was summarised (in different versions) by Arrian and Plutarch, two Greek writers of the Roman Empire, who endorsed it as the most reliable record of Alexander’s last days. Some scholars, led by the Australian classicist Brian Bosworth, believe the Royal Journals were falsified to make Alexander’s death appear natural, just as Stone’s film represents (though in Bosworth’s view the culprit was Eumenes, Alexander’s court secretary, rather than Ptolemy). Others disagree, taking the Journals to be just what Arrian and Plutarch thought they were, an undoctored, day-by-day eyewitness account.',\n",
              " '* * *',\n",
              " '* * *',\n",
              " 'The debate over the Royal Journals has huge implications for our understanding of Alexander’s death, because Arrian and Plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources. Both authors say that Alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named Medius. His fever grew worse over the course of 10 or 12 days (the two accounts differ in chronology), leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak. As his troops shuffled past his sickbed, Arrian reports, Alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one. Death followed the next day.',\n",
              " 'But a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that Stone followed in Alexander. In this alternate version Alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and, more importantly, just as he drained a huge cup of wine. These accounts say that Alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud. From that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms, including great pain, convulsions and delirium, but they say little or nothing about fever, the keynote of the Plutarch and Arrian accounts.',\n",
              " 'A stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison, which is why Plutarch, in his biography of Alexander, vehemently denied that it had occurred. ‘Some writers think they have to say such things, as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama’, he sneered. Apparently the dispute between those who thought Alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder – essentially, those who did or did not trust the Royal Journals – was already rife in Plutarch’s day. Probably all reports of Alexander’s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely.',\n",
              " 'For supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is, of course, ‘whodunnit?’ Stone’s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question. In the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the Companions to show that they know Alexander’s cup contains poison, but no clue is given as to how it got there. By contrast many Greek and Roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it, but how and with what poison. With remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at Antipater, the senior general whom Alexander had left in charge of the Macedonian homeland, and at two of his sons, Cassander and Iollas.',\n",
              " 'Antipater may indeed have had reason to want Alexander dead in the spring of 323 BC, for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to Babylon, perhaps with hostile intent. Antipater stayed put but sent Cassander in his stead. According to several ancient accounts Antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water, collected from the legendary river Styx (believed to flow above ground in the northern Peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld). The water had to be transported in a hollowed-out mule’s hoof, for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn. In Babylon, ran the story, Cassander passed this mule’s hoof to his brother Iollas – conveniently enough, Alexander’s wine-pourer – who then slipped the toxin into the king’s drink.',\n",
              " 'The basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling, but details vary. Some versions mention the philosopher Aristotle as a co-conspirator; he was a known friend of Antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student Alexander, who had sanctioned the death of his relative Callisthenes. Others make Medius, the host of the final, fatal dinner party and allegedly Iollas’ male lover, a participant in the plot. One very early version, published in an anonymous Greek pamphlet, now known as The Last Days and Testament of Alexander, made Iollas doubly guilty: when the first draught of poison failed to kill Alexander, Iollas administered a second, soaking in Styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit.',\n",
              " 'Until recently historians dismissed the story of the Styx water-poisoning as a fiction, possibly a political smear designed to harm Antipater and Cassander. Both were contestants for power in the era after Alexander’s death and had many enemies, especially Olympias, Alexander’s vengeful mother (who, perhaps to help foster the idea of Antipater’s family’s guilt, eventually had Iollas’ grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind). Even the idea that ordinary Greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd. In 1913 the distinguished classicist J.G. Frazer declared that the waters the Greeks identified as the Styx, today called Blackwater or Mavroneri, contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century.',\n",
              " 'But, in a presentation at a conference in Barcelona in 2010, the historian Adrienne Mayor and the toxicologist Antoinette Hayes proposed that the limestone around Mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin. Chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today (though they may have disappeared over the centuries). Mayor and Hayes argue that ‘calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for Alexander’ – including his high fever, usually seen as proof of a natural death.',\n",
              " 'The research of Mayor and Hayes might suggest that Alexander was murdered, though the authors themselves stop short of that claim. They are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself. Their thesis that the Styx really was strongly toxic would account for why Antipater and his sons were the ancient world’s prime suspects: Cassander’s journey from Europe to Babylon just a few weeks before the onset of Alexander’s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which Styx water could have arrived at the king’s banquet table. (Cassander later helped confirm the ancient world’s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of Macedonia and executing Alexander’s mother, wife and son.)',\n",
              " 'The authors are also interested in how, in the Greek imagination, the mythic resonance of the Styx, a river thought able to stupefy even the gods, made it an ideal weapon for Antipater and his sons to use. ‘Such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to Alexander’, Mayor said recently. ‘An ordinary, common drug would not do. Only a very rare, potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for Alexander.’',\n",
              " 'It remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of Antipater’s conspiracy can help crack the mystery. But it is clear that the Mayor-Hayes approach, matching toxins available to the ancient world with Alexander’s reported symptoms, has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery. Three other investigators have pursued it in recent years, combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin: Ptolemy, one of Alexander’s leading generals, committed the murder with arsenic; Rhoxane, the king’s wife, did it with strychnine; Alexander’s physicians did it, but by accident, with powdered hellebore root.',\n",
              " 'The last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the New Zealand toxicologist Leo Schep and the Scotland Yard detective John Grieve. These two men were brought together in a 2009 television documentary, Alexander the Great’s Mysterious Death. Schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore, used medicinally by the ancient Greeks but lethal in large doses, could best account for Alexander’s recorded symptoms. Grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin, as Schep had supposed, but by Alexander’s doctors, who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him.',\n",
              " 'Grieve’s ingenious speculation is only that, but has already won the endorsement of at least one Alexander specialist, the British classicist Richard Stoneman. ‘Hellebore, despite its dangers, was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects’, Stoneman notes. ‘But it was easy to get the dose wrong, and Alexander’s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in Babylon – or even misread the Babylonian label.’',\n",
              " 'But the toxicology on which Schep and Grieve rely is evidently not an exact science, especially when practiced at a distance of 2,300 years. The author Graham Phillips submitted the same record of Alexander’s symptoms as Schep’s to the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Center but obtained a very different answer. In his 2004 book Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon Phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like Alexander’s.',\n",
              " 'Following a twisting, at times tortuous, trail of logic Phillips tries to identify Alexander’s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine. The poisonous plant is rare along Alexander’s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent (modern Pakistan). Not all of Alexander’s retinue followed him into such areas, allowing Phillips to eliminate potential suspects. He concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill Alexander also had the means: Rhoxane, the first of the king’s three wives. She had become enraged at Alexander, Phillips assumes, by his two subsequent marriages to Persian princesses and killed him. This view of Rhoxane as a latter-day Medea revives one popularised in the 17th-century English tragedy by Nataniel Lee, The Rival Queens, but is not supported by evidence. (Oliver Stone, too, portrays Rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman, though he makes her guilty of the death of Hephaestion – in his view, Alexander’s male lover – rather than Alexander himself.)',\n",
              " 'Arsenic gets the spotlight in a 2004 book, The Death of Alexander the Great by Paul Doherty, novelist and amateur historian. Doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by Plutarch and the Roman writer Quintus Curtius: Alexander’s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of Babylon for a week or more. Doherty cites toxicology studies of the 19th century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification. However the jury seems to be out on this point and, for obvious reasons, opportunities for field tests are few.',\n",
              " 'If Alexander’s body really did resist decomposition – and some experts consider the story a fiction – then numerous explanations have to be considered. Those who believe Alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol. Strychnine, hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents. Defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the non-decay phenomenon: Alexander, in their view, only appeared to die on June 11th; he actually entered a deep coma. He may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him.',\n",
              " 'Doherty’s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at Ptolemy as its lead suspect. Ptolemy got the best post-Alexander assignment of any of the leading generals, a posting in wealthy Egypt. He eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries, until finally lost by his descendant Cleopatra in 30 BC. Doherty argues backward from Ptolemy’s later success, reasoning that he who gained the most from Alexander’s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about. It is the same thinking that Oliver Stone used when he made Ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in Alexander. As the director said in the Berkeley interview: ‘I go back to [the film] JFK: Cui bono? Who benefits?’',\n",
              " 'It is startling to think that Ptolemy or Rhoxane, two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to Alexander, may have wanted him dead, but those possibilities cannot be ruled out. Neither can Stone’s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in Alexander’s murder, at least by not intervening to prevent it (‘By silence we consented’). Indeed John Atkinson, a South African classicist, has put forward a scenario very much like that of Stone’s film in a 2009 journal article entitled ‘Alexander’s Last Days: Malaria and Mind Games?’ (co-authored with two medical specialists, Elsie and Etienne Truter).',\n",
              " 'Like Stone, Atkinson portrays an Alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates. ‘The officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap’, he and his co-authors write. ‘Men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger.’ In Atkinson’s view the campaigns Alexander had in mind in June 323 BC – including conquest of Arabia, Carthage and the entire Mediterranean coast – were a bridge too far for Alexander’s officers. Having turned him back from the East by mutiny, he argues, these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the West.',\n",
              " 'Even while regarding Alexander as a pariah to his own people, Atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned, seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms. His verdict is something closer to euthanasia: after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the ‘mind games’ of the article’s title. ‘The officers in Alexander’s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive’, Atkinson writes. ‘Maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die.’',\n",
              " 'And so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions. Ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever, even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios. Mayor and Hayes raise the possibility that Alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered; John Grieve suspects he was poisoned, but by accident. Atkinson makes the case that Alexander’s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural, but something in between.',\n",
              " 'If the embalmed body of Alexander is ever found – and some researchers continue to hunt for it – we may finally learn what caused his death, but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century AD (it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at Alexandria). Meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Justin and Quintus Curtius. Unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots.',\n",
              " 'With physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the Alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories. Opponents of such theories have long noted that Alexander himself, during the 10 or 12 days he slid towards death, never gave any sign that he suspected poison, though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years. He would never have gone willingly to his death (as Oliver Stone’s film appears to imply), nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him. A slow decline would allow him to order their executions. To assert that Alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled.',\n",
              " 'The same point could be made about what followed Alexander’s death. The chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination. If the goal of the generals was to ‘go home and spend their dough’, as Oliver Stone asserted in his Berkeley interview, they failed miserably. None ever returned to Macedonia and only Ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security. Many of the others continued fighting and killing each other. Given how central Alexander was to the stability of their world, they had no reason in June 323 BC to expect otherwise.',\n",
              " 'Any plan to poison Alexander would have been fraught with perils, especially for Macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins. Conspiracy theories have to assume that Alexander’s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything. It is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them: as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king. Thus it is easier, in the end, to believe that Alexander died of disease, despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise.',\n",

              "{'Who Killed Alexander The Great': ['In his article, James Romm explores the enduring mystery surrounding the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, an event that has baffled historians and sparked numerous theories over the centuries. Despite his robust health and seemingly divine status, Alexander’s sudden death at 32 in Babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership, plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the Wars of the Successors. While some historians suggest natural causes like disease, others propose theories of murder, fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death. Oliver Stone’s film Alexander reignited interest in these theories, suggesting a conspiracy among Alexander’s generals. Various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians. Despite extensive historical, forensic, and toxicological research, including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with Alexander’s symptoms, the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation, leaving one of history’s greatest mysteries unsolved. by James Romm In Babylon on June 11th, 323 BC, at about 5pm, Alexander the Great died aged 32, having conquered an empire stretching from modern Albania to eastern Pakistan. The question of what, or who, killed the Macedonian king has never been answered successfully. Today new theories are heating up one of history’s longest-running cold cases. Like the death of Stalin, to which it is sometimes compared, the death of Alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible. Conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king’s body was cold, but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects. Fuel was added to the fire by Oliver Stone‘s Alexander, released in 2004 with new versions in 2006 and 2008: a film that, whatever its artistic flaws, presents a historically informed theory about who killed Alexander and why. Few events have been as unexpected as the death of Alexander. The king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his 12-year campaign through Asia, enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles. Some had come to think of him as divine, an idea fostered, and perhaps entertained, by Alexander himself. In 325, fighting almost single-handed against South Asian warriors, Alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow, yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches, a 60-day trek along the barren coast of southern Iran. Consequently, when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later, the shock felt by his 50,000-strong army was intense. So was the confusion about who would next lead it, for Alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir (though one would be born shortly after his death). The sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point, the start of a half-century of instability and strife known today as the Wars of the Successors. Events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes. It is disturbing to think that blind chance – a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito – put the ancient world on a perilous new course. An explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring, even though it involves a darker view of Alexander’s relations with his Companions, the inner circle of friends and high-ranking officers that surrounded him in Babylon. Ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of Alexander’s death, though many attribute it to disease. In 1996 Eugene Borza, a scholar specialising in ancient Macedon, took part in a medical board of inquiry at the University of Maryland, which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever; Borza has since defended that finding in print. Malaria, smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed, with alcoholism, infection from the lung wound and grief – Alexander’s close friend Hephaestion had died some months earlier – often seen as complicating factors. But some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness, or even to choose between illness or murder: two Alexander experts who once made this choice (one on each side) later changed their opinions to undecided. With historical research at an impasse, Alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches. Armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology, they are re-opening the Alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation. The idea that Alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in 2004, thanks to the ending of Stone’s film. In its epilogue Alexander’s senior general Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins), looking back over decades at his commander’s death, declares: ‘The truth is, we did kill him. By silence, we consented … Because we couldn’t go on.’ Ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again. ‘You shall write: He died of disease, and in weakened condition.’ The idea that Alexander’s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of Stone’s famously plot-prone imagination. There is some evidence that not even Alexander’s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere. In India in 325 BC, at the eastern edge of the Indus river system, Alexander’s army staged a sit-down strike, when ordered to march eastward towards the Ganges. Even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny. Stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy, since Alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death. ‘I can’t believe that these men were going on with Alexander’ to Arabia and Carthage, he said in a 2008 interview at the University of California, Berkeley. Stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that Ptolemy masterminded a cover-up of Alexander’s murder, but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed. The account Ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of Alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the Royal Journals. Though now lost it was summarised (in different versions) by Arrian and Plutarch, two Greek writers of the Roman Empire, who endorsed it as the most reliable record of Alexander’s last days. Some scholars, led by the Australian classicist Brian Bosworth, believe the Royal Journals were falsified to make Alexander’s death appear natural, just as Stone’s film represents (though in Bosworth’s view the culprit was Eumenes, Alexander’s court secretary, rather than Ptolemy). Others disagree, taking the Journals to be just what Arrian and Plutarch thought they were, an undoctored, day-by-day eyewitness account. * * * * * * The debate over the Royal Journals has huge implications for our understanding of Alexander’s death, because Arrian and Plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources. Both authors say that Alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named Medius. His fever grew worse over the course of 10 or 12 days (the two accounts differ in chronology), leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak. As his troops shuffled past his sickbed, Arrian reports, Alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one. Death followed the next day. But a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that Stone followed in Alexander. In this alternate version Alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and, more importantly, just as he drained a huge cup of wine. These accounts say that Alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud. From that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms, including great pain, convulsions and delirium, but they say little or nothing about fever, the keynote of the Plutarch and Arrian accounts. A stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison, which is why Plutarch, in his biography of Alexander, vehemently denied that it had occurred. ‘Some writers think they have to say such things, as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama’, he sneered. Apparently the dispute between those who thought Alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder – essentially, those who did or did not trust the Royal Journals – was already rife in Plutarch’s day. Probably all reports of Alexander’s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely. For supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is, of course, ‘whodunnit?’ Stone’s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question. In the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the Companions to show that they know Alexander’s cup contains poison, but no clue is given as to how it got there. By contrast many Greek and Roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it, but how and with what poison. With remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at Antipater, the senior general whom Alexander had left in charge of the Macedonian homeland, and at two of his sons, Cassander and Iollas. Antipater may indeed have had reason to want Alexander dead in the spring of 323 BC, for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to Babylon, perhaps with hostile intent. Antipater stayed put but sent Cassander in his stead. According to several ancient accounts Antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water, collected from the legendary river Styx (believed to flow above ground in the northern Peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld). The water had to be transported in a hollowed-out mule’s hoof, for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn. In Babylon, ran the story, Cassander passed this mule’s hoof to his brother Iollas – conveniently enough, Alexander’s wine-pourer – who then slipped the toxin into the king’s drink. The basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling, but details vary. Some versions mention the philosopher Aristotle as a co-conspirator; he was a known friend of Antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student Alexander, who had sanctioned the death of his relative Callisthenes. Others make Medius, the host of the final, fatal dinner party and allegedly Iollas’ male lover, a participant in the plot. One very early version, published in an anonymous Greek pamphlet, now known as The Last Days and Testament of Alexander, made Iollas doubly guilty: when the first draught of poison failed to kill Alexander, Iollas administered a second, soaking in Styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit. Until recently historians dismissed the story of the Styx water-poisoning as a fiction, possibly a political smear designed to harm Antipater and Cassander. Both were contestants for power in the era after Alexander’s death and had many enemies, especially Olympias, Alexander’s vengeful mother (who, perhaps to help foster the idea of Antipater’s family’s guilt, eventually had Iollas’ grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind). Even the idea that ordinary Greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd. In 1913 the distinguished classicist J.G. Frazer declared that the waters the Greeks identified as the Styx, today called Blackwater or Mavroneri, contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century. But, in a presentation at a conference in Barcelona in 2010, the historian Adrienne Mayor and the toxicologist Antoinette Hayes proposed that the limestone around Mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin. Chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today (though they may have disappeared over the centuries). Mayor and Hayes argue that ‘calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for Alexander’ – including his high fever, usually seen as proof of a natural death. The research of Mayor and Hayes might suggest that Alexander was murdered, though the authors themselves stop short of that claim. They are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself. Their thesis that the Styx really was strongly toxic would account for why Antipater and his sons were the ancient world’s prime suspects: Cassander’s journey from Europe to Babylon just a few weeks before the onset of Alexander’s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which Styx water could have arrived at the king’s banquet table. (Cassander later helped confirm the ancient world’s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of Macedonia and executing Alexander’s mother, wife and son.) The authors are also interested in how, in the Greek imagination, the mythic resonance of the Styx, a river thought able to stupefy even the gods, made it an ideal weapon for Antipater and his sons to use. ‘Such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to Alexander’, Mayor said recently. ‘An ordinary, common drug would not do. Only a very rare, potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for Alexander.’ It remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of Antipater’s conspiracy can help crack the mystery. But it is clear that the Mayor-Hayes approach, matching toxins available to the ancient world with Alexander’s reported symptoms, has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery. Three other investigators have pursued it in recent years, combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin: Ptolemy, one of Alexander’s leading generals, committed the murder with arsenic; Rhoxane, the king’s wife, did it with strychnine; Alexander’s physicians did it, but by accident, with powdered hellebore root. The last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the New Zealand toxicologist Leo Schep and the Scotland Yard detective John Grieve. These two men were brought together in a 2009 television documentary, Alexander the Great’s Mysterious Death. Schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore, used medicinally by the ancient Greeks but lethal in large doses, could best account for Alexander’s recorded symptoms. Grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin, as Schep had supposed, but by Alexander’s doctors, who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him. Grieve’s ingenious speculation is only that, but has already won the endorsement of at least one Alexander specialist, the British classicist Richard Stoneman. ‘Hellebore, despite its dangers, was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects’, Stoneman notes. ‘But it was easy to get the dose wrong, and Alexander’s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in Babylon – or even misread the Babylonian label.’ But the toxicology on which Schep and Grieve rely is evidently not an exact science, especially when practiced at a distance of 2,300 years. The author Graham Phillips submitted the same record of Alexander’s symptoms as Schep’s to the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Center but obtained a very different answer. In his 2004 book Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon Phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like Alexander’s. Following a twisting, at times tortuous, trail of logic Phillips tries to identify Alexander’s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine. The poisonous plant is rare along Alexander’s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent (modern Pakistan). Not all of Alexander’s retinue followed him into such areas, allowing Phillips to eliminate potential suspects. He concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill Alexander also had the means: Rhoxane, the first of the king’s three wives. She had become enraged at Alexander, Phillips assumes, by his two subsequent marriages to Persian princesses and killed him. This view of Rhoxane as a latter-day Medea revives one popularised in the 17th-century English tragedy by Nataniel Lee, The Rival Queens, but is not supported by evidence. (Oliver Stone, too, portrays Rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman, though he makes her guilty of the death of Hephaestion – in his view, Alexander’s male lover – rather than Alexander himself.) Arsenic gets the spotlight in a 2004 book, The Death of Alexander the Great by Paul Doherty, novelist and amateur historian. Doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by Plutarch and the Roman writer Quintus Curtius: Alexander’s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of Babylon for a week or more. Doherty cites toxicology studies of the 19th century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification. However the jury seems to be out on this point and, for obvious reasons, opportunities for field tests are few. If Alexander’s body really did resist decomposition – and some experts consider the story a fiction – then numerous explanations have to be considered. Those who believe Alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol. Strychnine, hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents. Defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the non-decay phenomenon: Alexander, in their view, only appeared to die on June 11th; he actually entered a deep coma. He may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him. Doherty’s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at Ptolemy as its lead suspect. Ptolemy got the best post-Alexander assignment of any of the leading generals, a posting in wealthy Egypt. He eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries, until finally lost by his descendant Cleopatra in 30 BC. Doherty argues backward from Ptolemy’s later success, reasoning that he who gained the most from Alexander’s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about. It is the same thinking that Oliver Stone used when he made Ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in Alexander. As the director said in the Berkeley interview: ‘I go back to [the film] JFK: Cui bono? Who benefits?’ It is startling to think that Ptolemy or Rhoxane, two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to Alexander, may have wanted him dead, but those possibilities cannot be ruled out. Neither can Stone’s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in Alexander’s murder, at least by not intervening to prevent it (‘By silence we consented’). Indeed John Atkinson, a South African classicist, has put forward a scenario very much like that of Stone’s film in a 2009 journal article entitled ‘Alexander’s Last Days: Malaria and Mind Games?’ (co-authored with two medical specialists, Elsie and Etienne Truter). Like Stone, Atkinson portrays an Alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates. ‘The officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap’, he and his co-authors write. ‘Men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger.’ In Atkinson’s view the campaigns Alexander had in mind in June 323 BC – including conquest of Arabia, Carthage and the entire Mediterranean coast – were a bridge too far for Alexander’s officers. Having turned him back from the East by mutiny, he argues, these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the West. Even while regarding Alexander as a pariah to his own people, Atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned, seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms. His verdict is something closer to euthanasia: after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the ‘mind games’ of the article’s title. ‘The officers in Alexander’s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive’, Atkinson writes. ‘Maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die.’ And so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions. Ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever, even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios. Mayor and Hayes raise the possibility that Alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered; John Grieve suspects he was poisoned, but by accident. Atkinson makes the case that Alexander’s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural, but something in between. If the embalmed body of Alexander is ever found – and some researchers continue to hunt for it – we may finally learn what caused his death, but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century AD (it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at Alexandria). Meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Justin and Quintus Curtius. Unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots. With physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the Alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories. Opponents of such theories have long noted that Alexander himself, during the 10 or 12 days he slid towards death, never gave any sign that he suspected poison, though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years. He would never have gone willingly to his death (as Oliver Stone’s film appears to imply), nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him. A slow decline would allow him to order their executions. To assert that Alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled. The same point could be made about what followed Alexander’s death. The chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination. If the goal of the generals was to ‘go home and spend their dough’, as Oliver Stone asserted in his Berkeley interview, they failed miserably. None ever returned to Macedonia and only Ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security. Many of the others continued fighting and killing each other. Given how central Alexander was to the stability of their world, they had no reason in June 323 BC to expect otherwise. Any plan to poison Alexander would have been fraught with perils, especially for Macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins. Conspiracy theories have to assume that Alexander’s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything. It is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them: as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king. Thus it is easier, in the end, to believe that Alexander died of disease, despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise. About the Author:\\nJames Romm is James H.

              " 'Napeleon A Corsican Eagle Flown into Legend': ['The irresistible rise and rapid fall of the man who shook Europe in less than twenty years by Mario Galloni From an artillery officer to a general, then king, and finally emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte was everything: a military genius, politician, jurist, and creative talent supported by unparalleled dynamism. He lent his name to ambition and did so in a minimal amount of time. In the handful of years between Austerlitz and Waterloo, he took the world. When defeated, he had marked it forever. Then, from the exile of Saint Helena, he soared into legend. It all began on another island, Corsica, where the future general was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio to a family of ancient and noble Tuscan origins: his father Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, a lawyer, and his mother Maria Letizia Ramolino, a descendant of a wealthy Italian family. At ten, a scholarship opened the doors to the exclusive military school of Brienne-le-Château in northern France, where the offspring of high lineage learned the art of war. It was five years of study and reading, and also of taunts: his classmates didn’t forgive his Corsican origin and his halting French. Napoleon emerged with a quarrelsome and solitary disposition and a strong spirit of revenge, pride bolstered by a bitter anti-French resentment. His military career progressed rapidly: in 1784, he moved to the Royal School of Paris, and at just sixteen years old, he was assigned to an artillery regiment stationed at La Fère in Picardy. When the revolution broke out in 1789, Napoleon joined and obtained a leave to return to Corsica, hoping the new upheavals could benefit the island’s cause. However, he had to flee in 1793 with his family after breaking with the independence front. In Paris, the revolution had already led to the Reign of Terror, and the guillotine was in full swing. Appointed captain, he was sent by the Committee of Public Health to suppress dissent in Marseille, later taking command of the troops in Toulon, where monarchists, supported by the English, had entrenched themselves. The young officer brilliantly resolved the city’s siege, exhibiting artillery force management that already revealed the genius strategist. A success that earned him the rank of brigade general and the attention of future Directory member Paul Barras, who two years later, on October 5, 1795, appointed him commander of the Paris garrison: Napoleon saved the National Convention by quelling the royalist uprising in blood. He was named general of the Army Corps of the Interior: at only 26 years old, he was a rapidly rising star. Marriage to Josephine and the Italian Triumphs In the Capital, the young Corsican met the high society: he went to the theater, organized dinners, and stepped into the influential salons. He was captivated by the charm of Josephine Tasher, widow Beauharnais, a great lady with a thousand connections, older than him, in debt, but still the owner of a rich income. She bet on the magnetic-eyed soldier; he on a refined woman capable of polishing his manners. On March 9, 1796, he married her and, on the 27th of the same month, was already in Nice commanding the Army of Italy, ready to battle Austria, the leader of the coalition among the major European monarchies terrified by the specter of the “revolutionary plague.” The campaign began on April 12; on May 14, Napoleon entered Milan as a conqueror. In just over a month, the young military man, having delivered to legend, took everyone by surprise by attacking from Liguria, dividing the enemy front, and routing first the Piedmontese and then the Austrians of the old general Beaulieu, literally at the mercy of the rival’s strategic choices. Leading an exhausted, poorly paid, scarcely equipped, outnumbered army, Napoleon accomplished his first masterpiece, built on the innovative management of troops, meticulous preparation of battles, selection of officers as courageous and bold as him, and the ability to revitalize the army by instilling a common sentiment that becomes a shared dream of glory when the bond between troop and leader solidifies into fanatic devotion to the commander. In Italy, Napoleon discovered he had greatness equal to his ambition. And he began to serve both. On August 5 at Castiglione delle Stiviere, he won his first major field battle, pushing to Venice and forcing Austria to the Treaty of Campoformio. Crowned with the laurel of the victor, he became politically cumbersome in France. The Directory preferred to distance him from Paris by entrusting him with the occupation of Egypt, aimed at countering British economic interests in the seas. The campaign was a failure: despite the victorious Battle of the Pyramids fought on July 21, 1798, the commander had to witness the complete destruction of the fleet by the hands of English Admiral Horatio Nelson and surrender to the impossibility of taking the ancient Crusader fortress of Saint John of Acre. Returning home, he found the Directory in crisis and the army in tatters. There was no choice but a coup. On November 9, 1799 (according to the revolutionary calendar, 18 Brumaire), Bonaparte dissolved the Chambers, power passed to three consuls who introduced a new constitution, then ratified by a plebiscite. Appointed First Consul, the general had the country in his hands and shaped it on a model of strong administrative centralization: the country was divided into departments with the new figure of the prefect at the helm. He also resolved the long-standing dispute with the Church, signing the concordat that established the state’s secularity. He founded the National Bank and reorganized the educational system, including the lycée, the forge of the new ruling class. But if France was his, Italy was slipping away. The second anti-French coalition had overturned some of the republics born from the first expedition, so the First Consul returned to war and victory, first at Montebello and then at Marengo, on June 14, 1800. From the triumph was born, in 1802, the Italian Republic, of which Bonaparte became president, while the Treaty of Amiens signed with the United Kingdom granted two years of respite to Europe. At Notre-Dame, in 1804, Napoleon received from Pope Pius VII the crown of French emperor; the following year in Milan, in the Duomo, he placed the Iron Crown of King of Italy on his head. French Emperor and King of Italy At the height of glory and power, he targeted England. But the planned invasion of the island clashed with the disproportion of naval forces and foundered after the annihilation of the fleet at Trafalgar by Nelson. In 1805, Napoleon faced the third anti-French coalition, which this time involved England, Austria, and Russia, sending his most valiant marshal, Andrea Massena, to “disturb” the Austrians in Italy, while he personally took command of the “Grande Armée.” It was the eve of Austerlitz, Bonaparte’s strategic masterpiece: on December 3, 1805, on the anniversary of his coronation, he defeated the Austro-Russians. The following year he also defeated Frederick William II’s Prussia at Jena and made his triumphant entrance into Berlin. In 1807 at Friedland, the army of Tsar Alexander capitulated. Practically unbeatable, leading an army drunk with success, the emperor now imposed the Continental Blockade, forbidding ships flying the English flag from docking at any port, thus hoping to bend the British economy. To the pope who refused to adhere, he responded with the capture of Rome and the annexation of the Papal States to the empire, and when the excommunication bull arrived, he had the pontiff arrested, who was then transferred to France, first to Grenoble and then to Fontainebleau. The blockade, however, was a failure. Too many states circumvented it, including Portugal, which was invaded in retaliation. Napoleon then took advantage of the dynastic dispute between Charles IV and his son to force both to abdicate and place his brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, without, however, managing to tame the guerrillas or even to annihilate the English expeditionary force that in the meantime had liberated the Lusitanian state. Despite the difficulties, in 1809 he also bent the fifth coalition (yet another alliance between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom), defeated from a position of undisputed military superiority. He occupied Vienna and the Schönbrunn Castle and dictated a harsh peace to the Austrians. Meanwhile, he agreed with their prime minister Metternich on a state marriage capable of definitively reconciling France and Austria and, hopefully, of granting the emperor the longed-for male heir. He had divorced Josephine, his beloved but unfaithful companion, and now married Maria Luisa of Austria, niece of Marie Antoinette. But the son born in 1811, Napoleon Francis, known as the King of Rome, would never ascend the throne and would die at just 21 years old. Determined to strike a final blow against Tsar Alexander, the Emperor attempted the invasion of Russia, a titanic endeavor that ended in an epochal defeat. The numbers don’t lie: the Emperor set off at the head of an army of 700,000 men, of which over 400,000 would never return. The defeat gave rise to the European powers. Napoleon, back in France, worked night and day to rebuild the army, about 400,000 strong, largely young recruits. The wounded old lion was enough to keep the Prussians at bay, but not the bulk of the coalition, including the Austrians, who did not seem to greatly respect the previous year’s marriage. The French army capitulated at Leipzig. Napoleon entrusted the regency to his wife and the capital to his brother, then took the lead of 60,000 veterans and for two months kept the enemy forces at bay, eventually yielding to the Prussians. On March 31, 1813, Tsar Alexander entered Paris. Napoleon was forced to abdicate. After an attempted suicide with arsenic, miraculously thwarted, and a moving farewell to the Old Guard, he reached Marseille and sailed for his exile on Elba. On the island, he vented his hyperactivity by building roads and infrastructure and kept a watchful eye on Paris where Louis XVIII, back on the throne after his abdication, had already alienated the favor of the people. Fleeing from Elba to the legendary ‘Hundred Days’ Ten months of confinement were enough. He escaped British surveillance and on March 1, 1815, landed at Antibes: the legendary ‘Hundred Days’ began. Marching towards Paris, he raised unexpected popular enthusiasm: his mere appearance was enough to persuade the troops sent against him by the king to mutiny. Back on the throne, he reorganized the army and promulgated a more liberal constitution. The final duel awaited him. He faced his usual enemies, with the United Kingdom and Prussia at the forefront. He still planned to divide the predominant opposing forces, but the maneuver only partially succeeded. Waterloo would be the last chapter of the inimitable military history of the fabulous Corsican. Tactical and organizational errors would decree the historic defeat of June 18, 1815, also weighed down by the choice of generals not up to the task. Having found refuge in the Château de Malmaison, Napoleon awaited his fate: on July 15, he surrendered to the British. Convinced he could live as a private citizen in England or the United States, he instead faced life imprisonment on the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. On that speck of land, closely watched by a British contingent, the man who had been master of Europe died on May 5, 1821, at 17:49, struck down by stomach cancer. Buried on the island, his body was only returned to Paris for a solemn funeral in 1840. Since 1861, he rests in a monumental tomb in the Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides. THE GREATEST LEGACY: THE NAPOLEONIC CODE\\nDuring his exile on the Island of Saint Helena, following the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon often emphasized that his most important work, the one that would go down in history more than his military victories, would be the Napoleonic Code. He was right. Promulgated in 36 laws on March 21, 1804 – followed by the Code of Civil Procedure in 1806 and the Commercial Code in 1807 – it was the first modern civil code, of which Napoleon was not only the inspirer and promoter but also shared in its drafting, entrusted to four great jurists. It is thanks to Napoleon, who lacked legal knowledge, that the Code is noted for its particular clarity. Still in force in France and Belgium, and a model for the Italian and Spanish codes, the Napoleonic Code confirmed the major achievements of the French Revolution, while distancing itself from the excesses of the legislation from 1789-1804: legal equality before the law, religious freedom, the right to private property, and the secularism of the state, putting an end to the legacies of the Ancien Régime, feudalism, absolutism, creating a predominantly bourgeois society. NAPOLEON ACCORDING TO RIDLEY SCOTT’S FILM\\nThe unfulfilled dream of Stanley Kubrick was realized by Ridley Scott, who, over twenty years after Gladiator, finds his “emperor” Joaquin Phoenix again, this time in the role of Napoleon, in the biopic produced by Apple Original and distributed by Sony Pictures, one of the most anticipated films of fall 2023. Vanessa Kirby, skyrocketed to fame after her role in The Crown, portrays the first wife of the French emperor, Josephine Bonaparte. The cast also includes Tahar Rahim, Scott Caine, Ben Miles, and Paul Rhys. The film retraces Bonaparte’s unstoppable rise to power through his tumultuous relationship with his only true love, Josephine, showcasing the visionary political and military strategies of the great leader, in some of the most realistic and spectacular battle scenes ever made. The screenplay is written by David Scarpa, who had previously collaborated with Scott on All the Money in the World. Conoscere la Storia, December/January 2024 * * * ORIGINAL ITALIAN ARTICLE: L’irresistibile ascesa e la repentina caduta dell’uomo che sconvolse l’Europa in meno di vent’anni di Mario Galloni Da ufficiale d’artiglieria a generale, poi re e infine imperatore. Napoleone Bonaparte è stato tutto: genio militare, politico, giurista, talento creativo sostenuto da un dinamismo senza pari. Ha dato il suo nome all’ambizione e lo ha fatto in un tempo minimo. In quel pugno di anni che separano Austerlitz da Waterloo si è preso il mondo. Quando, sconfìtto, lo ha restituito, la sua impronta l’aveva segnato per sempre. Poi dall’esilio di Sant’Elena ha spiccato il volo nella leggenda. Tutto era cominciato su un’altra isola, la Corsica, dove il futuro generale nasce il 15 agosto 1769 ad Ajaccio da una famiglia di antiche e nobili origini toscane: il padre Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, avvocato, la madre Maria Letizia Ramolino, discendente di un’agiata casata italiana. A dieci anni una borsa di studio gli spalanca le porte dell’esclusiva scuola militare di Brienne-le-Château, nord della Francia, dove imparano l’arte della guerra i pargoli di alto lignaggio. Sarà un lustro di studio e letture, e anche di sberleffi: i compagni non gli perdonano l’origine corsa e quel francese zoppicante. Napoleone ne uscirà con una disposizione d’animo scontrosa e solitaria e un forte spirito di rivalsa, l’orgoglio rafforzato da un acre risentimento antifrancese. La carriera militare procede spedita: nel 1784 passa alla Regia scuola di Parigi e a soli sedici anni viene assegnato ad un reggimento di artiglieria di stanza a La Fère, in Piccardia. Quando scoppia la rivoluzione, nel 1789, Napoleone aderisce e ottiene una licenza per tornare in Corsica, sperando che i nuovi fermenti possano giovare alla causa dell’isola. Dovrà invece fuggire nel 1793 con tutta la famiglia dopo aver rotto con il fronte indipendentista. A Parigi la rivoluzione è già sfociata nel Terrore, la ghigliottina lavora a pieno regime. Nominato capitano, viene inviato dal Comitato di Salute Pubblica a reprimere il dissenso a Marsiglia, in seguito prenderà il comando delle truppe a Tolone, dove i monarchici, sostenuti dagli inglesi, si sono trincerati. Il giovane ufficiale risolve brillantemente l’assedio della città, esibendo una gestione delle forze d’artiglieria che già rivela il geniale stratega. Un successo che gli vale la nomina a generale di brigata e l’attenzione del futuro membro del Direttorio Paul Barras, che due anni dopo, il 5 ottobre 1795, lo nomina comandante della piazza di Parigi: Napoleone salva la Convenzione nazionale soffocando nel sangue la rivolta monarchica. Arriva la nomina a generale del Corpo d’armata dell’Interno: a soli 26 anni è una stella in rapida ascesa. Il matrimonio con Giuseppina e i trionfi italiani Nella Capitale il giovane corso incontra il gran mondo: va a teatro, organizza cene e mette piede nei salotti che contano. Rimane stregato dal fascino di Giuseppina Tasher, vedova Beauharnais, gran signora dalle mille relazioni, più grande di lui, indebitata, ma pur sempre titolare di una ricca rendita: lei scommette su quel militare dallo sguardo magnetico, lui su una donna raffinata in grado di ripulirne modi e maniere. Il 9 marzo 1796 la sposa e il 27 dello stesso mese è già a Nizza al comando dell’Armata d’Italia pronta a dar battaglia all’Austria, capofila della coalizione tra le maggiori monarchie europee terrorizzate dallo spettro della “peste rivoluzionaria”. La campagna comincia il 12 aprile; il 14 maggio Napoleone entra da trionfatore a Milano. In poco più di un mese, consegnato alla leggenda, il giovane militare ha spiazzato tutti attaccando dalla Liguria, diviso il fronte nemico e sbaragliato prima i piemontesi e poi gli austriaci del vecchio generale Beaulieu, letteralmente in balia delle scelte strategiche del rivale. A capo di un esercito infiacchito, mal pagato, scarsamente equipaggiato, inferiore di numero, Napoleone ha compiuto il suo primo capolavoro, costruito sulla gestione innovativa delle truppe, la meticolosa preparazione degli scontri, la scelta di ufficiali coraggiosi e spavaldi quanto lui, la capacità di rivitalizzare l’esercito consegnando agli uomini un comune sentire che diventa sogno di gloria condiviso quando il rapporto tra truppa e condottiero si salda al punto da diventare devozione fanatica al condottiero. Napoleone in Italia scopre dunque di avere una grandezza pari alla sua ambizione. E comincia a servire entrambe. Il 5 agosto a Castiglione delle Stiviere vince la sua prima grande battaglia campale spingendosi fino a Venezia e costringendo l’Austria al trattato di Campoformio. Cinto dall’alloro del trionfatore, in Francia diventa politicamente ingombrante. Il Direttorio preferisce allontanarlo da Parigi affidandogli l’occupazione dell’Egitto, volta a contrastare gli interessi economici inglesi sui mari. La campagna sarà un fallimento: nonostante la vittoriosa battaglia delle Piramidi combattuta il 21 luglio 1798, il condottiero dovrà assistere alla completa distruzione della flotta per mano dell’ammiraglio inglese Horatio Nelson e arrendersi all’impossibilità di prendere l’antica fortezza crociata di San Giovanni d’Acri. Fatto ritorno in patria, trova il Direttorio in crisi e l’esercito a pezzi. Non resta che il colpo di stato. Il 9 novembre 1799 (secondo il calendario rivoluzionario, 18 brumaio) Bonaparte fa sciogliere le Camere, il potere passa a tre consoli che varano una nuova costituzione, poi ratificata da un plebiscito. Fattosi nominare Primo Console, il generale ha in mano il Paese e lo modella sul modello di un forte accentramento amministrativo: il Paese viene diviso in dipartimenti con a capo la nuova figura del prefetto. Chiude anche l’annoso contenzioso con la Chiesa, siglando il concordato che sancisce la laicità dello Stato. Fonda la Banca nazionale e riorganizza il sistema scolastico dove trova spazio il liceo, fucina della nuova classe dirigente. Ma se la Francia è sua, l’Italia gli sta sfuggendo. La seconda coalizione antifrancese ha rovesciato parte delle repubbliche figlie della prima spedizione, così il Primo Console torna alla guerra e alla vittoria, prima a Montebello e poi a Marengo, il 14 giugno 1800. Dal trionfo nasce, nel 1802, la Repubblica italiana di cui Bonaparte diviene presidente, mentre il trattato di Amiens stipulato con il Regno Unito regala due anni di tregua all’Europa. A Notre-Dame, nel 1804, Napoleone riceve da papa Pio VII la corona di imperatore francese; l’anno dopo a Milano, in Duomo, cinge quella Ferrea di re d’Italia. Imperatore francese e re d’Italia All’apice della gloria e del potere, mette nel mirino l’Inghilterra. Ma la progettata invasione dell’isola si scontra con la sproporzione delle forze navali e naufraga dopo l’annientamento, a Trafalgar, della flotta a opera ancora di Nelson. Nel 1805 Napoleone fronteggia quindi la terza coalizione antifrancese che stavolta vede impegnate Inghilterra, Austria e Russia, spedendo il suo più valente maresciallo, Andrea Massena, a “disturbare” gli austriaci in Italia, mentre in persona assume il comando della “Grande Armata”. È la vigilia di Austerlitz, capolavoro strategico di Bonaparte: il 3 dicembre 1805, nell’anniversario della sua incoronazione, sbaraglia gli austro-russi. L’anno seguente sconfìgge anche la Prussia di Federico Guglielmo II a Jena e fa il suo trionfale ingresso a Berlino. Nel 1807 a Friedland capitola l’esercito dello zar Alessandro. Praticamente imbattibile, alla testa di un’armata ebbra di successi, l’imperatore impone ora il blocco continentale, vietando alle navi battenti bandiera inglese l’attracco in qualsiasi porto, auspicando così di piegare l’economia britannica. Al papa che rifiuta di aderirvi risponde con la presa di Roma e l’annessione dello Stato pontificio all’impero e quando arriva la bolla di scomunica fa arrestare il pontefice che verrà trasferito in Francia, prima a Grenoble e poi a Fontainebleau. Il blocco è però un insuccesso. Troppi gli Stati che lo aggirano, fra questi il Portogallo che per rappresaglia viene invaso. In seguito Napoleone approfitta della disputa dinastica tra Carlo IV e il figlio per costringere entrambi ad abdicare e porre sul trono di Spagna il fratello Giuseppe, senza però riuscire a domare la guerriglia e nemmeno ad annientare il corpo di spedizione inglese che nel frattempo ha liberato lo Stato lusitano. Nonostante le difficoltà, nel 1809 piega anche la quinta coalizione (ennesima alleanza fra Impero austriaco e Regno Unito), sconfitta dall’alto di una indiscussa superiorità militare. Occupa Vienna e il castello di Schönbrunn e detta agli austriaci una pace durissima. Intanto si accorda con il loro primo ministro Metternich per un matrimonio di stato in grado di conciliare definitivamente Francia e Austria e, sperabilmente, di regalare all’imperatore l’agognato erede maschio. Aveva divorziato da Giuseppina, adorata ma infedele compagna, ora impalma Maria Luisa d’Austria, nipote di Maria Antonietta. Ma il figlio che nasce nel 1811, Napoleone Francesco, detto il re di Roma, non salirà mai sul trono e morirà a soli 21 anni. Deciso ad assestare un colpo definitivo anche allo zar Alessandro, l’imperatore tenta l’invasione della Russia, un’impresa titanica che si chiuderà con una sconfitta epocale. I numeri non mentono: l’imperatore parte alla testa di un esercito di 700 mila uomini dei quali oltre 400 mila non faranno mai ritorno. La disfatta fa rialzare la testa alle potenze europee. Napoleone rientrato in Francia lavora notte e giorno a rimettere in piedi l’esercito, circa 400 mila effettivi, in gran parte giovani reclute. Al vecchio leone ferito bastano per tenere a bada i prussiani ma non il grosso della coalizione, compresi gli austriaci che non sembrano tenere in gran conto il matrimonio dell’anno precedente. L’esercito francese capitola a Lipsia. Napoleone affida la reggenza alla moglie e la capitale al fratello, quindi si mette alla testa di 60 mila veterani e per due mesi tiene a bada le forze nemiche, dovendo poi cedere ai prussiani. Il 31 marzo 1813 lo zar Alessandro entra a Parigi. Napoleone è costretto ad abdicare. Dopo un tentativo di suicidio con l’arsenico, miracolosamente sventato, e un commovente addio alla Vecchia Guardia, raggiunge Marsiglia e salpa per il suo confino all’Elba. Sull’isola sfoga il suo iperattivismo costruendo strade e infrastrutture e tiene un occhio vigile su Parigi dove Luigi XVIII, tornato sul trono dopo la sua abdicazione, si è già alienato i favori del popolo. In fuga dall’Elba verso i leggendari “cento giorni” Dieci mesi di confino possono bastare. Fugge alla vigilanza inglese e il primo marzo 1815 sbarca ad Antibes: cominciano i leggendari “cento giorni”. In marcia verso Parigi solleva un inaspettato entusiasmo popolare: per convincere all’ammutinamento le truppe inviategli contro dal re basta la sua sola apparizione. Di nuovo sul trono, riorganizza l’esercito e promulga una costituzione più liberale. Lo aspetta il duello finale. Di fronte ha i nemici di sempre, Regno Unito e Prussia in prima fila. Progetta ancora di dividere le preponderanti forze avversarie, ma la manovra riesce solo parzialmente. Waterloo sarà l’ultimo capitolo dell’inimitabile storia militare del favoloso corso. Errori tattici e organizzativi decreteranno la storica disfatta del 18 giugno 1815, sulla quale pesa anche la scelta di generali non all’altezza. Trovato rifugio nel castello di Malmaison, Napoleone attende il suo destino: il 15 luglio si arrende agli inglesi. E convinto di poter vivere da privato cittadino in Inghilterra o negli Stati Uniti, lo aspetta invece l’ergastolo nella sperduta isola di Sant’Elena nell’Oceano Atlantico. In quel fazzoletto di terra, controllato a vista da un contingente inglese, l’uomo che era stato padrone d’Europa muore il 5 maggio 1821 alle ore 17:49, stroncato da un tumore allo stomaco. Sepolto sull’isola, la salma rientrerà a Parigi per un funerale solenne soltanto nel 1840. Dal 1861 riposa in una tomba monumentale nella Chiesa di Saint-Louis des Invalides. L’EREDITÀ PIÙ GRANDE: IL CODICE NAPOLEONICO\\nDurante l’esilio nell’Isola di Sant’Elena, seguito alla sconfitta di Waterloo, Napoleone sottolineò più volte che la sua opera più importante, quella che sarebbe passata alla storia più delle battaglie vinte, sarebbe stato il Codice Napoleonico. Aveva ragione. Promulgato in 36 leggi il 21 marzo 1804 – seguirono il Codice di procedura civile nel 1806 e il Codice di commercio nel 1807 – fu il primo codice civile moderno, di cui Napoleone non fu solo l’ispiratore e il promotore ma ne condivise la redazione, affidata a quattro grandi giuristi. Si deve proprio a Napoleone, privo di nozioni giuridiche, la particolare chiarezza dell’articolato. Tutt’ora in vigore in Francia e Belgio, e modello per quello italiano e spagnolo, il Codice napoleonico confermava le maggiori conquiste della Rivoluzione Francese, pur distanziandosi dagli eccessi della legislazione del 1789-1804: l’uguaglianza giuridica di fronte alla legge, la libertà religiosa, il diritto di proprietà privata e la laicità dello stato, ponendo fine ai retaggi dell’Ancién regime, del feudalesimo, dell’assolutismo, creando una società prevalentemente borghese. NAPOLEONE SECONDO IL FILM DI RIDLEY SCOTT\\nIl sogno irrealizzato di Stanley Kubrick l’ha firmato Ridley Scott, che a distanza di oltre vent’anni da Il Gladiatore ritrova il suo “imperatore” Joaquin Phoenix, allora Commodo questa volta nei panni di Napoleone, interprete del biopic prodotto da Apple Original, e distribuito da Sony Pictures, tra i film più attesi dell’autunno 2023. Vanessa Kirby, lanciatissima dopo la sua partecipazione in The Crown, offre il volto alla prima moglie dell’imperatore francese, Giuseppina Bonaparte. Fanno parte del cast anche Tahar Rahim, Scott Caine, Ben Miles e Paul Rhys. La pellicola ripercorre l’inarrestabile scalata al potere di Bonaparte attraverso la burrascosa relazione con il suo unico vero amore, Giuseppina, mostrando le visionarie strategie politiche e militari del grande condottiero, in alcune delle scene di battaglia più realistiche e spettacolari mai realizzate. La sceneggiatura è scritta da David Scarpa, che aveva già collaborato con Scott per Tutti i soldi del mondo.

              " 'Eye Witness to Iran Hostage Crisis Tehran 4 Nov,1979': ['by Jonathan O’Callaghan In 1979, Mark Lijek was working at the US Embassy in Tehran as a consular officer along with his wife, a consular assistant. On 4 November 1979, the embassy was stormed by Iranian protestors, forcing Lijek, his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by Canada and the CIA. At 9am on Sunday 4 November 1979, Mark Lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of Iranian protestors climbed the gate of the US Embassy in Tehran. The attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between Iran and the US, culminating in what would be one of the modern era’s highest-profile hostage crises. As the embassy fell into Iranian hands, however, Lijek and five others, including his wife, would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country. Their incredible story was retold in the Oscar-winning 2012 film Argo, but here Lijek tells us what really happened. Lijek served as a consular officer for the US Embassy in Tehran, while his wife Cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office. “Most of the Americans worked in two buildings; the vast majority were in the Chancellery, which was in the south centre of the compound, and the rest of us worked in the consular annex, which was about a five-minute walk to the northwest,” explains Lijek. “Our compound was very large, 26 acres [10 hectares] and about a mile [1.6 kilometres] of wall, and we had 13 marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing, so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question. The plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue.” It quickly became apparent, though, that rescue was out of the question. “We had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons, locked everything down, and we basically just sat there,” continues Lijek. “We didn’t see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour. Finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building. “Eventually, somebody noticed our building was not fully protected. It was brand new, we had all these latest security upgrades, but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows. They were just normal glass, no bars, no nothing. So somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in, and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder. He pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below. A friend and I grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together, but if they really wanted to break through they could have, and I’m not sure why we were left alone from that point on, but we sort of were.” It became a very nervous wait for Lijek and his colleagues. The electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait, which they did for two hours. “Finally we were told that we should try to get to the British compound,” says Lijek. “There was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go, but given the circumstances we didn’t have much choice.” The marine opened the door and one of Lijek’s friends crept out, finding three policemen who didn’t have any objections to them leaving. The Iranian customers and\\xa0employees in the building had already made a break to get home, leaving just 13 Americans behind. It was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success; the two married couples, Lijek and his wife being one, left in the first group of six with two civilian Americans who were there on business. “I assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first, and in fact that’s how it turned out,” explains Lijek. ”We made it. That second group that left a few minutes after us did not, with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me, this fella Bob Anders, our immigration chief.” In addition to the embassy swarming with protestors, the streets were alive with revolutionaries. ”I was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us,” says Lijek, “and in fact that’s exactly what happened to that second group of Americans. They followed us but we came to the first major north-south street, and we turned south, which was the proper direction to go to the British compound. The second group, which included our boss, the consular general, decided to go to his house and play bridge instead, so they turned north. And apparently that little change in plan got them caught, because they got about 150 yards [135 metres] north and some guy with a G3 [rifle] came running after them, rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy.” Lijek and his group made their way to the British compound through the narrow city streets, but when they got to Ferdowsi Square, which was right in front of the compound, they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path. Ducking into an alley, they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to Anders’ apartment and wait out the trouble. “You have to remember, we’re still thinking all we’ve got to do is hide out for a few hours, we did not know that there would be no rescue,” says Lijek. “So once we got to Bob’s place we were feeling pretty good. We sat around, had a nice lunch, had a few drinks, listened to the BBC describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and we’d be back at work tomorrow.” By 11pm, four of them, Lijek and his wife and the other couple, Joe and Kathy Stafford, made their way to the Iran-America Society to spend the night. The following day they were on the move again, this time finally to the British compound after a brief stop at the Staffords’ apartment, but all the while an uncooperative Washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were. That Monday, 5 November, the British Embassy (separate from the British compound they were in) was attacked. “The compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in,” says Lijek “Frankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it. So London and Washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you.” Lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again. “As it was, we did feel like we’d been abandoned,” he reveals. Virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee, known as a komiteh, and Lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught. The group were moved to a US Embassy house under the care of a Thai cook called Sam, but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper, an elderly Thai lady, was not comfortable with them being there. After a row between Sam and her on 10 November, she left the house in a foul mood, and the Americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence. Fortunately, Anders had been in contact with his Canadian counterpart, John Sheardown, who insisted they join him at his residence at the Canadian Embassy, which hadn’t been touched by the Iranians. At the Sheardown residence they were able to relax, to an extent. As Americans who had been in the US Embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the Iranians would almost certainly hold them captive, along with the 52 other American hostages. The Canadians were extremely welcoming, however, and Prime Minister Joe Clark sanctioned their stay, unbeknown to the Iranians, of course. They would end up remaining there for two months and, while not uncomfortable, it was not without peril. “In terms of specific threats, one really was John’s gardener,” explains Lijek. “He was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us, and that was kind of a problem because John’s house had a lot of glass walls, and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted. There were other little things, like the garbage; John had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house you’ve got seven [an additional member of the group was added, who had been hiding with the Swedes, while the Staffords were in a residence nearby]. The garbage man was also a member of the komiteh, so John had to start carrying the garbage to work. The other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord, so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days. But we didn’t like going outside, we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons. On one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of Iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road. That was really nice of them but, I mean, it was outside of my comfort zone! It’s not that I expected everybody to know my face or whatever, it’s not like they were putting up wanted posters, but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful.” By January, Lijek’s group was getting restless, so they asked the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor to relay a message to Washington asking for help to leave Iran. But it would not be until late January that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out. The CIA had put together a fake science-fiction movie called Argo, complete with posters, a script and press releases, and the plan was to pretend the group were Hollywood employees out in Tehran shooting a movie. ”We didn’t really know anything about the CIA or the specifics of the plan until 26 January when [CIA agent] Tony Mendez and his partner, Julio, came to the house in the evening,” explains Lijek. ”We were briefed on three possible options [for escape]: one of course was the Hollywood scenario, but it was pretty obvious from the way Tony presented them that the other two were throwaways. One, I think, had us as agronomists or something like that, and the other I think we were people involved in a petroleum venture. The Hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility, frankly, because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done? Hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality, it seems, and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime.” Lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan. They were each given roles to play; Lijek was the transportation coordinator for the ‘movie’, his wife the scriptwriter, and so on. They were given new identities, new passports and told to alter their appearance. However, one member of their group, Joe Stafford, did not like the plan at all. “He thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released, which to me made no sense,” says Lijek. Stafford’s refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission. Thankfully, in the morning of 27 January, the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly. Unlike the 2012 movie, their journey to and through the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran was largely uneventful, apart from a brief delay for their plane. There was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed. Indeed, the plan went so well that Lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the Iranians: “What Tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us,” explains Lijek “A professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour, so the thing Tony didn’t want was for us to be nervous, so he needed us to believe in the scenario. We made a game of it, and with the exception of Joe we were having fun.” Aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour, the group ultimately boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich on the morning of Sunday 27 January 1980, finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close. “Once we got out of Iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief,” says Lijek. “We toasted each other and it was an amazing moment. It’s kind of hard to describe, there were just so many different emotions, including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind, but for ourselves it was like magic. I don’t think I’ve ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress, finally it just all of a sudden goes away. It was incredible.” Although they managed to escape relatively trouble free, not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily, and one man who remained uncertain was President Carter, who later said the Argo six’ had just a fifty-fifty chance of successfully leaving Iran. “I’m surprised he would have launched the operation with only a 50 per cent chance of success,” admits Lijek. ”I did ask Tony about that and he denied it, he said he figured we were at least 75-25 in favour, and that’s kind of what I would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in Tehran. “If Tony had told us we had a fifty-fifty chance, I don’t think we would have voted [to go]. One thing I did learn from the [2012 film Argo] was the risk we were running. It didn’t occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a CIA escort, you know we are spies at that point, and so who knows what they would do. That never really occurred to me until the movie came out.” Thankfully, the escape went according to plan, but while Lijek and his group were free in the USA by early 1980, the ordeal was far from over for the 52 other Americans who were still being held hostage in Iran. They would not be freed until a year later, on 20 January 1981, after Iraq invaded and forced Iran to enter negotiations with the US. Had the ‘Argo six’ left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed, on 4 November 1979, it’s almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity. However, they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country, thanks in no small part to the help from Canada, a gesture widely heralded across the United States. Such was Canada’s role alongside the CIA that the rescue of the ‘Argo six’ is now known as the Canadian Caper, and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten. \\xa0 * * * In the year leading up to the uprising, tensions between Iran and the United States had escalated when Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (or ruler) of Iran, was admitted to the US for cancer treatment. In February 1979, he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, leaving a provisional government in place. This government failed to quell the revolution and ultimately, on 4 November 1979, another uprising saw a group of Iranian students take over the US Embassy in Tehran. Although Lijek’s group escaped within a few months, 52 other Americans were held hostage until 20 January 1981, when they were released as a result of Iraq invading Iran in September 1980. The revolution brought to a head tensions between Iran and the US that still continue. * * * 09-00 am ♦\\xa0Storming the walls Iranian protestors climb the walls of the US Embassy in Tehran. 09:15 am ♦\\xa0The protestors storm and take the chancellery at the US Embassy. 9:30 am ♦\\xa0Lijek and his colleagues get their first glimpse of the protestors in the compound. 9:45 am ♦\\xa0Doors smashed in.

On 4 November 1979, the embassy was stormed by Iranian protestors, forcing Lijek, his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by Canada and the CIA. At 9am on Sunday 4 November 1979, Mark Lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of Iranian protestors climbed the gate of the US Embassy in Tehran. The attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between Iran and the US, culminating in what would be one of the modern era\\u2019s highest-profile hostage crises. As the embassy fell into Iranian hands, however, Lijek and five others, including his wife, would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country. Their incredible story was retold in the Oscar-winning 2012 film Argo, but here Lijek tells us what really happened. Lijek served as a consular officer for the US Embassy in Tehran, while his wife Cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office. \\u201cMost of the Americans worked in two buildings; the vast majority were in the Chancellery, which was in the south centre of the compound, and the rest of us worked in the consular annex, which was about a five-minute walk to the northwest,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201cOur compound was very large, 26 acres [10 hectares] and about a mile [1.6 kilometres] of wall, and we had 13 marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing, so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question. The plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue.\\u201d It quickly became apparent, though, that rescue was out of the question. \\u201cWe had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons, locked everything down, and we basically just sat there,\\u201d continues Lijek. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour. Finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building. \\u201cEventually, somebody noticed our building was not fully protected. It was brand new, we had all these latest security upgrades, but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows. They were just normal glass, no bars, no nothing. So somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in, and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder. He pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below. A friend and I grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together, but if they really wanted to break through they could have, and I\\u2019m not sure why we were left alone from that point on, but we sort of were.\\u201d It became a very nervous wait for Lijek and his colleagues. The electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait, which they did for two hours. \\u201cFinally we were told that we should try to get to the British compound,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cThere was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go, but given the circumstances we didn\\u2019t have much choice.\\u201d The marine opened the door and one of Lijek\\u2019s friends crept out, finding three policemen who didn\\u2019t have any objections to them leaving. The Iranian customers and\\u00a0employees in the building had already made a break to get home, leaving just 13 Americans behind. It was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success; the two married couples, Lijek and his wife being one, left in the first group of six with two civilian Americans who were there on business. \\u201cI assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first, and in fact that\\u2019s how it turned out,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201dWe made it. That second group that left a few minutes after us did not, with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me, this fella Bob Anders, our immigration chief.\\u201d In addition to the embassy swarming with protestors, the streets were alive with revolutionaries. \\u201dI was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us,\\u201d says Lijek, \\u201cand in fact that\\u2019s exactly what happened to that second group of Americans. They followed us but we came to the first major north-south street, and we turned south, which was the proper direction to go to the British compound. The second group, which included our boss, the consular general, decided to go to his house and play bridge instead, so they turned north. And apparently that little change in plan got them caught, because they got about 150 yards [135 metres] north and some guy with a G3 [rifle] came running after them, rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy.\\u201d Lijek and his group made their way to the British compound through the narrow city streets, but when they got to Ferdowsi Square, which was right in front of the compound, they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path. Ducking into an alley, they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to Anders\\u2019 apartment and wait out the trouble. \\u201cYou have to remember, we\\u2019re still thinking all we\\u2019ve got to do is hide out for a few hours, we did not know that there would be no rescue,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cSo once we got to Bob\\u2019s place we were feeling pretty good. We sat around, had a nice lunch, had a few drinks, listened to the BBC describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and we\\u2019d be back at work tomorrow.\\u201d By 11pm, four of them, Lijek and his wife and the other couple, Joe and Kathy Stafford, made their way to the Iran-America Society to spend the night. The following day they were on the move again, this time finally to the British compound after a brief stop at the Staffords\\u2019 apartment, but all the while an uncooperative Washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were. That Monday, 5 November, the British Embassy (separate from the British compound they were in) was attacked. \\u201cThe compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in,\\u201d says Lijek \\u201cFrankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it. So London and Washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you.\\u201d Lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again. \\u201cAs it was, we did feel like we\\u2019d been abandoned,\\u201d he reveals. Virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee, known as a komiteh, and Lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught. The group were moved to a US Embassy house under the care of a Thai cook called Sam, but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper, an elderly Thai lady, was not comfortable with them being there. After a row between Sam and her on 10 November, she left the house in a foul mood, and the Americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence. Fortunately, Anders had been in contact with his Canadian counterpart, John Sheardown, who insisted they join him at his residence at the Canadian Embassy, which hadn\\u2019t been touched by the Iranians. At the Sheardown residence they were able to relax, to an extent. As Americans who had been in the US Embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the Iranians would almost certainly hold them captive, along with the 52 other American hostages. The Canadians were extremely welcoming, however, and Prime Minister Joe Clark sanctioned their stay, unbeknown to the Iranians, of course. They would end up remaining there for two months and, while not uncomfortable, it was not without peril. \\u201cIn terms of specific threats, one really was John\\u2019s gardener,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201cHe was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us, and that was kind of a problem because John\\u2019s house had a lot of glass walls, and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted. There were other little things, like the garbage; John had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house you\\u2019ve got seven [an additional member of the group was added, who had been hiding with the Swedes, while the Staffords were in a residence nearby]. The garbage man was also a member of the komiteh, so John had to start carrying the garbage to work. The other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord, so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days. But we didn\\u2019t like going outside, we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons. On one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of Iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road. That was really nice of them but, I mean, it was outside of my comfort zone! It\\u2019s not that I expected everybody to know my face or whatever, it\\u2019s not like they were putting up wanted posters, but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful.\\u201d By January, Lijek\\u2019s group was getting restless, so they asked the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor to relay a message to Washington asking for help to leave Iran. But it would not be until late January that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out. The CIA had put together a fake science-fiction movie called Argo, complete with posters, a script and press releases, and the plan was to pretend the group were Hollywood employees out in Tehran shooting a movie. \\u201dWe didn\\u2019t really know anything about the CIA or the specifics of the plan until 26 January when [CIA agent] Tony Mendez and his partner, Julio, came to the house in the evening,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201dWe were briefed on three possible options [for escape]: one of course was the Hollywood scenario, but it was pretty obvious from the way Tony presented them that the other two were throwaways. One, I think, had us as agronomists or something like that, and the other I think we were people involved in a petroleum venture. The Hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility, frankly, because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done? Hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality, it seems, and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime.\\u201d Lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan. They were each given roles to play; Lijek was the transportation coordinator for the \\u2018movie\\u2019, his wife the scriptwriter, and so on. They were given new identities, new passports and told to alter their appearance. However, one member of their group, Joe Stafford, did not like the plan at all. \\u201cHe thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released, which to me made no sense,\\u201d says Lijek. Stafford\\u2019s refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission. Thankfully, in the morning of 27 January, the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly. Unlike the 2012 movie, their journey to and through the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran was largely uneventful, apart from a brief delay for their plane. There was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed. Indeed, the plan went so well that Lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the Iranians: \\u201cWhat Tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us,\\u201d explains Lijek \\u201cA professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour, so the thing Tony didn\\u2019t want was for us to be nervous, so he needed us to believe in the scenario. We made a game of it, and with the exception of Joe we were having fun.\\u201d Aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour, the group ultimately boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich on the morning of Sunday 27 January 1980, finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close. \\u201cOnce we got out of Iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cWe toasted each other and it was an amazing moment. It\\u2019s kind of hard to describe, there were just so many different emotions, including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind, but for ourselves it was like magic. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress, finally it just all of a sudden goes away. It was incredible.\\u201d Although they managed to escape relatively trouble free, not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily, and one man who remained uncertain was President Carter, who later said the Argo six\\u2019 had just a fifty-fifty chance of successfully leaving Iran. \\u201cI\\u2019m surprised he would have launched the operation with only a 50 per cent chance of success,\\u201d admits Lijek. \\u201dI did ask Tony about that and he denied it, he said he figured we were at least 75-25 in favour, and that\\u2019s kind of what I would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in Tehran. \\u201cIf Tony had told us we had a fifty-fifty chance, I don\\u2019t think we would have voted [to go]. One thing I did learn from the [2012 film Argo] was the risk we were running. It didn\\u2019t occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a CIA escort, you know we are spies at that point, and so who knows what they would do. That never really occurred to me until the movie came out.\\u201d Thankfully, the escape went according to plan, but while Lijek and his group were free in the USA by early 1980, the ordeal was far from over for the 52 other Americans who were still being held hostage in Iran. They would not be freed until a year later, on 20 January 1981, after Iraq invaded and forced Iran to enter negotiations with the US. Had the \\u2018Argo six\\u2019 left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed, on 4 November 1979, it\\u2019s almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity. However, they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country, thanks in no small part to the help from Canada, a gesture widely heralded across the United States. Such was Canada\\u2019s role alongside the CIA that the rescue of the \\u2018Argo six\\u2019 is now known as the Canadian Caper, and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten. \\u00a0 * * * In the year leading up to the uprising, tensions between Iran and the United States had escalated when Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (or ruler) of Iran, was admitted to the US for cancer treatment. In February 1979, he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, leaving a provisional government in place. This government failed to quell the revolution and ultimately, on 4 November 1979, another uprising saw a group of Iranian students take over the US Embassy in Tehran. Although Lijek\\u2019s group escaped within a few months, 52 other Americans were held hostage until 20 January 1981, when they were released as a result of Iraq invading Iran in September 1980. The revolution brought to a head tensions between Iran and the US that still continue. * * * 09-00 am \\u2666\\u00a0Storming the walls Iranian protestors climb the walls of the US Embassy in Tehran. 09:15 am \\u2666\\u00a0The protestors storm and take the chancellery at the US Embassy. 9:30 am \\u2666\\u00a0Lijek and his colleagues get their first glimpse of the protestors in the compound. 9:45 am \\u2666\\u00a0Doors smashed in.

He lent his name to ambition and did so in a minimal amount of time. In the handful of years between Austerlitz and Waterloo, he took the world. When defeated, he had marked it forever. Then, from the exile of Saint Helena, he soared into legend. It all began on another island, Corsica, where the future general was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio to a family of ancient and noble Tuscan origins: his father Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, a lawyer, and his mother Maria Letizia Ramolino, a descendant of a wealthy Italian family. At ten, a scholarship opened the doors to the exclusive military school of Brienne-le-Ch\\u00e2teau in northern France, where the offspring of high lineage learned the art of war. It was five years of study and reading, and also of taunts: his classmates didn\\u2019t forgive his Corsican origin and his halting French. Napoleon emerged with a quarrelsome and solitary disposition and a strong spirit of revenge, pride bolstered by a bitter anti-French resentment. His military career progressed rapidly: in 1784, he moved to the Royal School of Paris, and at just sixteen years old, he was assigned to an artillery regiment stationed at La F\\u00e8re in Picardy. When the revolution broke out in 1789, Napoleon joined and obtained a leave to return to Corsica, hoping the new upheavals could benefit the island\\u2019s cause. However, he had to flee in 1793 with his family after breaking with the independence front. In Paris, the revolution had already led to the Reign of Terror, and the guillotine was in full swing. Appointed captain, he was sent by the Committee of Public Health to suppress dissent in Marseille, later taking command of the troops in Toulon, where monarchists, supported by the English, had entrenched themselves. The young officer brilliantly resolved the city\\u2019s siege, exhibiting artillery force management that already revealed the genius strategist. A success that earned him the rank of brigade general and the attention of future Directory member Paul Barras, who two years later, on October 5, 1795, appointed him commander of the Paris garrison: Napoleon saved the National Convention by quelling the royalist uprising in blood. He was named general of the Army Corps of the Interior: at only 26 years old, he was a rapidly rising star. Marriage to Josephine and the Italian Triumphs In the Capital, the young Corsican met the high society: he went to the theater, organized dinners, and stepped into the influential salons. He was captivated by the charm of Josephine Tasher, widow Beauharnais, a great lady with a thousand connections, older than him, in debt, but still the owner of a rich income. She bet on the magnetic-eyed soldier; he on a refined woman capable of polishing his manners. On March 9, 1796, he married her and, on the 27th of the same month, was already in Nice commanding the Army of Italy, ready to battle Austria, the leader of the coalition among the major European monarchies terrified by the specter of the \\u201crevolutionary plague.\\u201d The campaign began on April 12; on May 14, Napoleon entered Milan as a conqueror. In just over a month, the young military man, having delivered to legend, took everyone by surprise by attacking from Liguria, dividing the enemy front, and routing first the Piedmontese and then the Austrians of the old general Beaulieu, literally at the mercy of the rival\\u2019s strategic choices. Leading an exhausted, poorly paid, scarcely equipped, outnumbered army, Napoleon accomplished his first masterpiece, built on the innovative management of troops, meticulous preparation of battles, selection of officers as courageous and bold as him, and the ability to revitalize the army by instilling a common sentiment that becomes a shared dream of glory when the bond between troop and leader solidifies into fanatic devotion to the commander. In Italy, Napoleon discovered he had greatness equal to his ambition. And he began to serve both. On August 5 at Castiglione delle Stiviere, he won his first major field battle, pushing to Venice and forcing Austria to the Treaty of Campoformio. Crowned with the laurel of the victor, he became politically cumbersome in France. The Directory preferred to distance him from Paris by entrusting him with the occupation of Egypt, aimed at countering British economic interests in the seas. The campaign was a failure: despite the victorious Battle of the Pyramids fought on July 21, 1798, the commander had to witness the complete destruction of the fleet by the hands of English Admiral Horatio Nelson and surrender to the impossibility of taking the ancient Crusader fortress of Saint John of Acre. Returning home, he found the Directory in crisis and the army in tatters. There was no choice but a coup. On November 9, 1799 (according to the revolutionary calendar, 18 Brumaire), Bonaparte dissolved the Chambers, power passed to three consuls who introduced a new constitution, then ratified by a plebiscite. Appointed First Consul, the general had the country in his hands and shaped it on a model of strong administrative centralization: the country was divided into departments with the new figure of the prefect at the helm. He also resolved the long-standing dispute with the Church, signing the concordat that established the state\\u2019s secularity. He founded the National Bank and reorganized the educational system, including the lyc\\u00e9e, the forge of the new ruling class. But if France was his, Italy was slipping away. The second anti-French coalition had overturned some of the republics born from the first expedition, so the First Consul returned to war and victory, first at Montebello and then at Marengo, on June 14, 1800. From the triumph was born, in 1802, the Italian Republic, of which Bonaparte became president, while the Treaty of Amiens signed with the United Kingdom granted two years of respite to Europe. At Notre-Dame, in 1804, Napoleon received from Pope Pius VII the crown of French emperor; the following year in Milan, in the Duomo, he placed the Iron Crown of King of Italy on his head. French Emperor and King of Italy At the height of glory and power, he targeted England. But the planned invasion of the island clashed with the disproportion of naval forces and foundered after the annihilation of the fleet at Trafalgar by Nelson. In 1805, Napoleon faced the third anti-French coalition, which this time involved England, Austria, and Russia, sending his most valiant marshal, Andrea Massena, to \\u201cdisturb\\u201d the Austrians in Italy, while he personally took command of the \\u201cGrande Arm\\u00e9e.\\u201d It was the eve of Austerlitz, Bonaparte\\u2019s strategic masterpiece: on December 3, 1805, on the anniversary of his coronation, he defeated the Austro-Russians. The following year he also defeated Frederick William II\\u2019s Prussia at Jena and made his triumphant entrance into Berlin. In 1807 at Friedland, the army of Tsar Alexander capitulated. Practically unbeatable, leading an army drunk with success, the emperor now imposed the Continental Blockade, forbidding ships flying the English flag from docking at any port, thus hoping to bend the British economy. To the pope who refused to adhere, he responded with the capture of Rome and the annexation of the Papal States to the empire, and when the excommunication bull arrived, he had the pontiff arrested, who was then transferred to France, first to Grenoble and then to Fontainebleau. The blockade, however, was a failure. Too many states circumvented it, including Portugal, which was invaded in retaliation. Napoleon then took advantage of the dynastic dispute between Charles IV and his son to force both to abdicate and place his brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, without, however, managing to tame the guerrillas or even to annihilate the English expeditionary force that in the meantime had liberated the Lusitanian state. Despite the difficulties, in 1809 he also bent the fifth coalition (yet another alliance between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom), defeated from a position of undisputed military superiority. He occupied Vienna and the Sch\\u00f6nbrunn Castle and dictated a harsh peace to the Austrians. Meanwhile, he agreed with their prime minister Metternich on a state marriage capable of definitively reconciling France and Austria and, hopefully, of granting the emperor the longed-for male heir. He had divorced Josephine, his beloved but unfaithful companion, and now married Maria Luisa of Austria, niece of Marie Antoinette. But the son born in 1811, Napoleon Francis, known as the King of Rome, would never ascend the throne and would die at just 21 years old. Determined to strike a final blow against Tsar Alexander, the Emperor attempted the invasion of Russia, a titanic endeavor that ended in an epochal defeat. The numbers don\\u2019t lie: the Emperor set off at the head of an army of 700,000 men, of which over 400,000 would never return. The defeat gave rise to the European powers. Napoleon, back in France, worked night and day to rebuild the army, about 400,000 strong, largely young recruits. The wounded old lion was enough to keep the Prussians at bay, but not the bulk of the coalition, including the Austrians, who did not seem to greatly respect the previous year\\u2019s marriage. The French army capitulated at Leipzig. Napoleon entrusted the regency to his wife and the capital to his brother, then took the lead of 60,000 veterans and for two months kept the enemy forces at bay, eventually yielding to the Prussians. On March 31, 1813, Tsar Alexander entered Paris. Napoleon was forced to abdicate. After an attempted suicide with arsenic, miraculously thwarted, and a moving farewell to the Old Guard, he reached Marseille and sailed for his exile on Elba. On the island, he vented his hyperactivity by building roads and infrastructure and kept a watchful eye on Paris where Louis XVIII, back on the throne after his abdication, had already alienated the favor of the people. Fleeing from Elba to the legendary \\u2018Hundred Days\\u2019 Ten months of confinement were enough. He escaped British surveillance and on March 1, 1815, landed at Antibes: the legendary \\u2018Hundred Days\\u2019 began. Marching towards Paris, he raised unexpected popular enthusiasm: his mere appearance was enough to persuade the troops sent against him by the king to mutiny. Back on the throne, he reorganized the army and promulgated a more liberal constitution. The final duel awaited him. He faced his usual enemies, with the United Kingdom and Prussia at the forefront. He still planned to divide the predominant opposing forces, but the maneuver only partially succeeded. Waterloo would be the last chapter of the inimitable military history of the fabulous Corsican. Tactical and organizational errors would decree the historic defeat of June 18, 1815, also weighed down by the choice of generals not up to the task. Having found refuge in the Ch\\u00e2teau de Malmaison, Napoleon awaited his fate: on July 15, he surrendered to the British. Convinced he could live as a private citizen in England or the United States, he instead faced life imprisonment on the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. On that speck of land, closely watched by a British contingent, the man who had been master of Europe died on May 5, 1821, at 17:49, struck down by stomach cancer. Buried on the island, his body was only returned to Paris for a solemn funeral in 1840. Since 1861, he rests in a monumental tomb in the Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides. THE GREATEST LEGACY: THE NAPOLEONIC CODE\\nDuring his exile on the Island of Saint Helena, following the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon often emphasized that his most important work, the one that would go down in history more than his military victories, would be the Napoleonic Code. He was right. Promulgated in 36 laws on March 21, 1804 \\u2013 followed by the Code of Civil Procedure in 1806 and the Commercial Code in 1807 \\u2013 it was the first modern civil code, of which Napoleon was not only the inspirer and promoter but also shared in its drafting, entrusted to four great jurists. It is thanks to Napoleon, who lacked legal knowledge, that the Code is noted for its particular clarity. Still in force in France and Belgium, and a model for the Italian and Spanish codes, the Napoleonic Code confirmed the major achievements of the French Revolution, while distancing itself from the excesses of the legislation from 1789-1804: legal equality before the law, religious freedom, the right to private property, and the secularism of the state, putting an end to the legacies of the Ancien R\\u00e9gime, feudalism, absolutism, creating a predominantly bourgeois society. NAPOLEON ACCORDING TO RIDLEY SCOTT\\u2019S FILM\\nThe unfulfilled dream of Stanley Kubrick was realized by Ridley Scott, who, over twenty years after Gladiator, finds his \\u201cemperor\\u201d Joaquin Phoenix again, this time in the role of Napoleon, in the biopic produced by Apple Original and distributed by Sony Pictures, one of the most anticipated films of fall 2023. Vanessa Kirby, skyrocketed to fame after her role in The Crown, portrays the first wife of the French emperor, Josephine Bonaparte. The cast also includes Tahar Rahim, Scott Caine, Ben Miles, and Paul Rhys. The film retraces Bonaparte\\u2019s unstoppable rise to power through his tumultuous relationship with his only true love, Josephine, showcasing the visionary political and military strategies of the great leader, in some of the most realistic and spectacular battle scenes ever made. The screenplay is written by David Scarpa, who had previously collaborated with Scott on All the Money in the World. Conoscere la Storia, December/January 2024 * * * ORIGINAL ITALIAN ARTICLE: L\\u2019irresistibile ascesa e la repentina caduta dell\\u2019uomo che sconvolse l\\u2019Europa in meno di vent\\u2019anni di Mario Galloni Da ufficiale d\\u2019artiglieria a generale, poi re e infine imperatore. Napoleone Bonaparte \\u00e8 stato tutto: genio militare, politico, giurista, talento creativo sostenuto da un dinamismo senza pari. Ha dato il suo nome all\\u2019ambizione e lo ha fatto in un tempo minimo. In quel pugno di anni che separano Austerlitz da Waterloo si \\u00e8 preso il mondo. Quando, sconf\\u00ectto, lo ha restituito, la sua impronta l\\u2019aveva segnato per sempre. Poi dall\\u2019esilio di Sant\\u2019Elena ha spiccato il volo nella leggenda. Tutto era cominciato su un\\u2019altra isola, la Corsica, dove il futuro generale nasce il 15 agosto 1769 ad Ajaccio da una famiglia di antiche e nobili origini toscane: il padre Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, avvocato, la madre Maria Letizia Ramolino, discendente di un\\u2019agiata casata italiana. A dieci anni una borsa di studio gli spalanca le porte dell\\u2019esclusiva scuola militare di Brienne-le-Ch\\u00e2teau, nord della Francia, dove imparano l\\u2019arte della guerra i pargoli di alto lignaggio. Sar\\u00e0 un lustro di studio e letture, e anche di sberleffi: i compagni non gli perdonano l\\u2019origine corsa e quel francese zoppicante. Napoleone ne uscir\\u00e0 con una disposizione d\\u2019animo scontrosa e solitaria e un forte spirito di rivalsa, l\\u2019orgoglio rafforzato da un acre risentimento antifrancese. La carriera militare procede spedita: nel 1784 passa alla Regia scuola di Parigi e a soli sedici anni viene assegnato ad un reggimento di artiglieria di stanza a La F\\u00e8re, in Piccardia. Quando scoppia la rivoluzione, nel 1789, Napoleone aderisce e ottiene una licenza per tornare in Corsica, sperando che i nuovi fermenti possano giovare alla causa dell\\u2019isola. Dovr\\u00e0 invece fuggire nel 1793 con tutta la famiglia dopo aver rotto con il fronte indipendentista. A Parigi la rivoluzione \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 sfociata nel Terrore, la ghigliottina lavora a pieno regime. Nominato capitano, viene inviato dal Comitato di Salute Pubblica a reprimere il dissenso a Marsiglia, in seguito prender\\u00e0 il comando delle truppe a Tolone, dove i monarchici, sostenuti dagli inglesi, si sono trincerati. Il giovane ufficiale risolve brillantemente l\\u2019assedio della citt\\u00e0, esibendo una gestione delle forze d\\u2019artiglieria che gi\\u00e0 rivela il geniale stratega. Un successo che gli vale la nomina a generale di brigata e l\\u2019attenzione del futuro membro del Direttorio Paul Barras, che due anni dopo, il 5 ottobre 1795, lo nomina comandante della piazza di Parigi: Napoleone salva la Convenzione nazionale soffocando nel sangue la rivolta monarchica. Arriva la nomina a generale del Corpo d\\u2019armata dell\\u2019Interno: a soli 26 anni \\u00e8 una stella in rapida ascesa. Il matrimonio con Giuseppina e i trionfi italiani Nella Capitale il giovane corso incontra il gran mondo: va a teatro, organizza cene e mette piede nei salotti che contano. Rimane stregato dal fascino di Giuseppina Tasher, vedova Beauharnais, gran signora dalle mille relazioni, pi\\u00f9 grande di lui, indebitata, ma pur sempre titolare di una ricca rendita: lei scommette su quel militare dallo sguardo magnetico, lui su una donna raffinata in grado di ripulirne modi e maniere. Il 9 marzo 1796 la sposa e il 27 dello stesso mese \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 a Nizza al comando dell\\u2019Armata d\\u2019Italia pronta a dar battaglia all\\u2019Austria, capofila della coalizione tra le maggiori monarchie europee terrorizzate dallo spettro della \\u201cpeste rivoluzionaria\\u201d. La campagna comincia il 12 aprile; il 14 maggio Napoleone entra da trionfatore a Milano. In poco pi\\u00f9 di un mese, consegnato alla leggenda, il giovane militare ha spiazzato tutti attaccando dalla Liguria, diviso il fronte nemico e sbaragliato prima i piemontesi e poi gli austriaci del vecchio generale Beaulieu, letteralmente in balia delle scelte strategiche del rivale. A capo di un esercito infiacchito, mal pagato, scarsamente equipaggiato, inferiore di numero, Napoleone ha compiuto il suo primo capolavoro, costruito sulla gestione innovativa delle truppe, la meticolosa preparazione degli scontri, la scelta di ufficiali coraggiosi e spavaldi quanto lui, la capacit\\u00e0 di rivitalizzare l\\u2019esercito consegnando agli uomini un comune sentire che diventa sogno di gloria condiviso quando il rapporto tra truppa e condottiero si salda al punto da diventare devozione fanatica al condottiero. Napoleone in Italia scopre dunque di avere una grandezza pari alla sua ambizione. E comincia a servire entrambe. Il 5 agosto a Castiglione delle Stiviere vince la sua prima grande battaglia campale spingendosi fino a Venezia e costringendo l\\u2019Austria al trattato di Campoformio. Cinto dall\\u2019alloro del trionfatore, in Francia diventa politicamente ingombrante. Il Direttorio preferisce allontanarlo da Parigi affidandogli l\\u2019occupazione dell\\u2019Egitto, volta a contrastare gli interessi economici inglesi sui mari. La campagna sar\\u00e0 un fallimento: nonostante la vittoriosa battaglia delle Piramidi combattuta il 21 luglio 1798, il condottiero dovr\\u00e0 assistere alla completa distruzione della flotta per mano dell\\u2019ammiraglio inglese Horatio Nelson e arrendersi all\\u2019impossibilit\\u00e0 di prendere l\\u2019antica fortezza crociata di San Giovanni d\\u2019Acri. Fatto ritorno in patria, trova il Direttorio in crisi e l\\u2019esercito a pezzi. Non resta che il colpo di stato. Il 9 novembre 1799 (secondo il calendario rivoluzionario, 18 brumaio) Bonaparte fa sciogliere le Camere, il potere passa a tre consoli che varano una nuova costituzione, poi ratificata da un plebiscito. Fattosi nominare Primo Console, il generale ha in mano il Paese e lo modella sul modello di un forte accentramento amministrativo: il Paese viene diviso in dipartimenti con a capo la nuova figura del prefetto. Chiude anche l\\u2019annoso contenzioso con la Chiesa, siglando il concordato che sancisce la laicit\\u00e0 dello Stato. Fonda la Banca nazionale e riorganizza il sistema scolastico dove trova spazio il liceo, fucina della nuova classe dirigente. Ma se la Francia \\u00e8 sua, l\\u2019Italia gli sta sfuggendo. La seconda coalizione antifrancese ha rovesciato parte delle repubbliche figlie della prima spedizione, cos\\u00ec il Primo Console torna alla guerra e alla vittoria, prima a Montebello e poi a Marengo, il 14 giugno 1800. Dal trionfo nasce, nel 1802, la Repubblica italiana di cui Bonaparte diviene presidente, mentre il trattato di Amiens stipulato con il Regno Unito regala due anni di tregua all\\u2019Europa. A Notre-Dame, nel 1804, Napoleone riceve da papa Pio VII la corona di imperatore francese; l\\u2019anno dopo a Milano, in Duomo, cinge quella Ferrea di re d\\u2019Italia. Imperatore francese e re d\\u2019Italia All\\u2019apice della gloria e del potere, mette nel mirino l\\u2019Inghilterra. Ma la progettata invasione dell\\u2019isola si scontra con la sproporzione delle forze navali e naufraga dopo l\\u2019annientamento, a Trafalgar, della flotta a opera ancora di Nelson. Nel 1805 Napoleone fronteggia quindi la terza coalizione antifrancese che stavolta vede impegnate Inghilterra, Austria e Russia, spedendo il suo pi\\u00f9 valente maresciallo, Andrea Massena, a \\u201cdisturbare\\u201d gli austriaci in Italia, mentre in persona assume il comando della \\u201cGrande Armata\\u201d. \\u00c8 la vigilia di Austerlitz, capolavoro strategico di Bonaparte: il 3 dicembre 1805, nell\\u2019anniversario della sua incoronazione, sbaraglia gli austro-russi. L\\u2019anno seguente sconf\\u00ecgge anche la Prussia di Federico Guglielmo II a Jena e fa il suo trionfale ingresso a Berlino. Nel 1807 a Friedland capitola l\\u2019esercito dello zar Alessandro. Praticamente imbattibile, alla testa di un\\u2019armata ebbra di successi, l\\u2019imperatore impone ora il blocco continentale, vietando alle navi battenti bandiera inglese l\\u2019attracco in qualsiasi porto, auspicando cos\\u00ec di piegare l\\u2019economia britannica. Al papa che rifiuta di aderirvi risponde con la presa di Roma e l\\u2019annessione dello Stato pontificio all\\u2019impero e quando arriva la bolla di scomunica fa arrestare il pontefice che verr\\u00e0 trasferito in Francia, prima a Grenoble e poi a Fontainebleau. Il blocco \\u00e8 per\\u00f2 un insuccesso. Troppi gli Stati che lo aggirano, fra questi il Portogallo che per rappresaglia viene invaso. In seguito Napoleone approfitta della disputa dinastica tra Carlo IV e il figlio per costringere entrambi ad abdicare e porre sul trono di Spagna il fratello Giuseppe, senza per\\u00f2 riuscire a domare la guerriglia e nemmeno ad annientare il corpo di spedizione inglese che nel frattempo ha liberato lo Stato lusitano. Nonostante le difficolt\\u00e0, nel 1809 piega anche la quinta coalizione (ennesima alleanza fra Impero austriaco e Regno Unito), sconfitta dall\\u2019alto di una indiscussa superiorit\\u00e0 militare. Occupa Vienna e il castello di Sch\\u00f6nbrunn e detta agli austriaci una pace durissima. Intanto si accorda con il loro primo ministro Metternich per un matrimonio di stato in grado di conciliare definitivamente Francia e Austria e, sperabilmente, di regalare all\\u2019imperatore l\\u2019agognato erede maschio. Aveva divorziato da Giuseppina, adorata ma infedele compagna, ora impalma Maria Luisa d\\u2019Austria, nipote di Maria Antonietta. Ma il figlio che nasce nel 1811, Napoleone Francesco, detto il re di Roma, non salir\\u00e0 mai sul trono e morir\\u00e0 a soli 21 anni. Deciso ad assestare un colpo definitivo anche allo zar Alessandro, l\\u2019imperatore tenta l\\u2019invasione della Russia, un\\u2019impresa titanica che si chiuder\\u00e0 con una sconfitta epocale. I numeri non mentono: l\\u2019imperatore parte alla testa di un esercito di 700 mila uomini dei quali oltre 400 mila non faranno mai ritorno. La disfatta fa rialzare la testa alle potenze europee. Napoleone rientrato in Francia lavora notte e giorno a rimettere in piedi l\\u2019esercito, circa 400 mila effettivi, in gran parte giovani reclute. Al vecchio leone ferito bastano per tenere a bada i prussiani ma non il grosso della coalizione, compresi gli austriaci che non sembrano tenere in gran conto il matrimonio dell\\u2019anno precedente. L\\u2019esercito francese capitola a Lipsia. Napoleone affida la reggenza alla moglie e la capitale al fratello, quindi si mette alla testa di 60 mila veterani e per due mesi tiene a bada le forze nemiche, dovendo poi cedere ai prussiani. Il 31 marzo 1813 lo zar Alessandro entra a Parigi. Napoleone \\u00e8 costretto ad abdicare. Dopo un tentativo di suicidio con l\\u2019arsenico, miracolosamente sventato, e un commovente addio alla Vecchia Guardia, raggiunge Marsiglia e salpa per il suo confino all\\u2019Elba. Sull\\u2019isola sfoga il suo iperattivismo costruendo strade e infrastrutture e tiene un occhio vigile su Parigi dove Luigi XVIII, tornato sul trono dopo la sua abdicazione, si \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 alienato i favori del popolo. In fuga dall\\u2019Elba verso i leggendari \\u201ccento giorni\\u201d Dieci mesi di confino possono bastare. Fugge alla vigilanza inglese e il primo marzo 1815 sbarca ad Antibes: cominciano i leggendari \\u201ccento giorni\\u201d. In marcia verso Parigi solleva un inaspettato entusiasmo popolare: per convincere all\\u2019ammutinamento le truppe inviategli contro dal re basta la sua sola apparizione. Di nuovo sul trono, riorganizza l\\u2019esercito e promulga una costituzione pi\\u00f9 liberale. Lo aspetta il duello finale. Di fronte ha i nemici di sempre, Regno Unito e Prussia in prima fila. Progetta ancora di dividere le preponderanti forze avversarie, ma la manovra riesce solo parzialmente. Waterloo sar\\u00e0 l\\u2019ultimo capitolo dell\\u2019inimitabile storia militare del favoloso corso. Errori tattici e organizzativi decreteranno la storica disfatta del 18 giugno 1815, sulla quale pesa anche la scelta di generali non all\\u2019altezza. Trovato rifugio nel castello di Malmaison, Napoleone attende il suo destino: il 15 luglio si arrende agli inglesi. E convinto di poter vivere da privato cittadino in Inghilterra o negli Stati Uniti, lo aspetta invece l\\u2019ergastolo nella sperduta isola di Sant\\u2019Elena nell\\u2019Oceano Atlantico. In quel fazzoletto di terra, controllato a vista da un contingente inglese, l\\u2019uomo che era stato padrone d\\u2019Europa muore il 5 maggio 1821 alle ore 17:49, stroncato da un tumore allo stomaco. Sepolto sull\\u2019isola, la salma rientrer\\u00e0 a Parigi per un funerale solenne soltanto nel 1840. Dal 1861 riposa in una tomba monumentale nella Chiesa di Saint-Louis des Invalides.

Tutt\\u2019ora in vigore in Francia e Belgio, e modello per quello italiano e spagnolo, il Codice napoleonico confermava le maggiori conquiste della Rivoluzione Francese, pur distanziandosi dagli eccessi della legislazione del 1789-1804: l\\u2019uguaglianza giuridica di fronte alla legge, la libert\\u00e0 religiosa, il diritto di propriet\\u00e0 privata e la laicit\\u00e0 dello stato, ponendo fine ai retaggi dell\\u2019Anci\\u00e9n regime, del feudalesimo, dell\\u2019assolutismo, creando una societ\\u00e0 prevalentemente borghese.

Despite his robust health and seemingly divine status, Alexander\\u2019s sudden death at 32 in Babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership, plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the Wars of the Successors. While some historians suggest natural causes like disease, others propose theories of murder, fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death. Oliver Stone\\u2019s film Alexander reignited interest in these theories, suggesting a conspiracy among Alexander\\u2019s generals. Various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians. Despite extensive historical, forensic, and toxicological research, including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with Alexander\\u2019s symptoms, the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation, leaving one of history\\u2019s greatest mysteries unsolved. by James Romm In Babylon on June 11th, 323 BC, at about 5pm, Alexander the Great died aged 32, having conquered an empire stretching from modern Albania to eastern Pakistan. The question of what, or who, killed the Macedonian king has never been answered successfully. Today new theories are heating up one of history\\u2019s longest-running cold cases. Like the death of Stalin, to which it is sometimes compared, the death of Alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible. Conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king\\u2019s body was cold, but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects. Fuel was added to the fire by Oliver Stone\\u2018s Alexander, released in 2004 with new versions in 2006 and 2008: a film that, whatever its artistic flaws, presents a historically informed theory about who killed Alexander and why. Few events have been as unexpected as the death of Alexander. The king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his 12-year campaign through Asia, enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles. Some had come to think of him as divine, an idea fostered, and perhaps entertained, by Alexander himself. In 325, fighting almost single-handed against South Asian warriors, Alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow, yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches, a 60-day trek along the barren coast of southern Iran. Consequently, when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later, the shock felt by his 50,000-strong army was intense. So was the confusion about who would next lead it, for Alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir (though one would be born shortly after his death). The sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point, the start of a half-century of instability and strife known today as the Wars of the Successors. Events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes. It is disturbing to think that blind chance \\u2013 a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito \\u2013 put the ancient world on a perilous new course. An explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring, even though it involves a darker view of Alexander\\u2019s relations with his Companions, the inner circle of friends and high-ranking officers that surrounded him in Babylon. Ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of Alexander\\u2019s death, though many attribute it to disease. In 1996 Eugene Borza, a scholar specialising in ancient Macedon, took part in a medical board of inquiry at the University of Maryland, which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever; Borza has since defended that finding in print. Malaria, smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed, with alcoholism, infection from the lung wound and grief \\u2013 Alexander\\u2019s close friend Hephaestion had died some months earlier \\u2013 often seen as complicating factors. But some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness, or even to choose between illness or murder: two Alexander experts who once made this choice (one on each side) later changed their opinions to undecided. With historical research at an impasse, Alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches. Armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology, they are re-opening the Alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation. The idea that Alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in 2004, thanks to the ending of Stone\\u2019s film. In its epilogue Alexander\\u2019s senior general Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins), looking back over decades at his commander\\u2019s death, declares: \\u2018The truth is, we did kill him. By silence, we consented \\u2026 Because we couldn\\u2019t go on.\\u2019 Ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again. \\u2018You shall write: He died of disease, and in weakened condition.\\u2019 The idea that Alexander\\u2019s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of Stone\\u2019s famously plot-prone imagination. There is some evidence that not even Alexander\\u2019s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere. In India in 325 BC, at the eastern edge of the Indus river system, Alexander\\u2019s army staged a sit-down strike, when ordered to march eastward towards the Ganges. Even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny. Stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy, since Alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death. \\u2018I can\\u2019t believe that these men were going on with Alexander\\u2019 to Arabia and Carthage, he said in a 2008 interview at the University of California, Berkeley. Stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that Ptolemy masterminded a cover-up of Alexander\\u2019s murder, but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed. The account Ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of Alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the Royal Journals. Though now lost it was summarised (in different versions) by Arrian and Plutarch, two Greek writers of the Roman Empire, who endorsed it as the most reliable record of Alexander\\u2019s last days. Some scholars, led by the Australian classicist Brian Bosworth, believe the Royal Journals were falsified to make Alexander\\u2019s death appear natural, just as Stone\\u2019s film represents (though in Bosworth\\u2019s view the culprit was Eumenes, Alexander\\u2019s court secretary, rather than Ptolemy). Others disagree, taking the Journals to be just what Arrian and Plutarch thought they were, an undoctored, day-by-day eyewitness account. * * * * * * The debate over the Royal Journals has huge implications for our understanding of Alexander\\u2019s death, because Arrian and Plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources. Both authors say that Alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named Medius. His fever grew worse over the course of 10 or 12 days (the two accounts differ in chronology), leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak. As his troops shuffled past his sickbed, Arrian reports, Alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one. Death followed the next day. But a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that Stone followed in Alexander. In this alternate version Alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and, more importantly, just as he drained a huge cup of wine. These accounts say that Alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud. From that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms, including great pain, convulsions and delirium, but they say little or nothing about fever, the keynote of the Plutarch and Arrian accounts. A stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison, which is why Plutarch, in his biography of Alexander, vehemently denied that it had occurred. \\u2018Some writers think they have to say such things, as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama\\u2019, he sneered. Apparently the dispute between those who thought Alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder \\u2013 essentially, those who did or did not trust the Royal Journals \\u2013 was already rife in Plutarch\\u2019s day. Probably all reports of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely. For supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is, of course, \\u2018whodunnit?\\u2019 Stone\\u2019s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question. In the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the Companions to show that they know Alexander\\u2019s cup contains poison, but no clue is given as to how it got there. By contrast many Greek and Roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it, but how and with what poison. With remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at Antipater, the senior general whom Alexander had left in charge of the Macedonian homeland, and at two of his sons, Cassander and Iollas. Antipater may indeed have had reason to want Alexander dead in the spring of 323 BC, for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to Babylon, perhaps with hostile intent. Antipater stayed put but sent Cassander in his stead. According to several ancient accounts Antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water, collected from the legendary river Styx (believed to flow above ground in the northern Peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld). The water had to be transported in a hollowed-out mule\\u2019s hoof, for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn. In Babylon, ran the story, Cassander passed this mule\\u2019s hoof to his brother Iollas \\u2013 conveniently enough, Alexander\\u2019s wine-pourer \\u2013 who then slipped the toxin into the king\\u2019s drink. The basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling, but details vary. Some versions mention the philosopher Aristotle as a co-conspirator; he was a known friend of Antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student Alexander, who had sanctioned the death of his relative Callisthenes. Others make Medius, the host of the final, fatal dinner party and allegedly Iollas\\u2019 male lover, a participant in the plot. One very early version, published in an anonymous Greek pamphlet, now known as The Last Days and Testament of Alexander, made Iollas doubly guilty: when the first draught of poison failed to kill Alexander, Iollas administered a second, soaking in Styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit. Until recently historians dismissed the story of the Styx water-poisoning as a fiction, possibly a political smear designed to harm Antipater and Cassander. Both were contestants for power in the era after Alexander\\u2019s death and had many enemies, especially Olympias, Alexander\\u2019s vengeful mother (who, perhaps to help foster the idea of Antipater\\u2019s family\\u2019s guilt, eventually had Iollas\\u2019 grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind). Even the idea that ordinary Greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd. In 1913 the distinguished classicist J.G. Frazer declared that the waters the Greeks identified as the Styx, today called Blackwater or Mavroneri, contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century. But, in a presentation at a conference in Barcelona in 2010, the historian Adrienne Mayor and the toxicologist Antoinette Hayes proposed that the limestone around Mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin. Chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today (though they may have disappeared over the centuries). Mayor and Hayes argue that \\u2018calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for Alexander\\u2019 \\u2013 including his high fever, usually seen as proof of a natural death. The research of Mayor and Hayes might suggest that Alexander was murdered, though the authors themselves stop short of that claim. They are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself. Their thesis that the Styx really was strongly toxic would account for why Antipater and his sons were the ancient world\\u2019s prime suspects: Cassander\\u2019s journey from Europe to Babylon just a few weeks before the onset of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which Styx water could have arrived at the king\\u2019s banquet table. (Cassander later helped confirm the ancient world\\u2019s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of Macedonia and executing Alexander\\u2019s mother, wife and son.) The authors are also interested in how, in the Greek imagination, the mythic resonance of the Styx, a river thought able to stupefy even the gods, made it an ideal weapon for Antipater and his sons to use. \\u2018Such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to Alexander\\u2019, Mayor said recently. \\u2018An ordinary, common drug would not do. Only a very rare, potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for Alexander.\\u2019 It remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of Antipater\\u2019s conspiracy can help crack the mystery. But it is clear that the Mayor-Hayes approach, matching toxins available to the ancient world with Alexander\\u2019s reported symptoms, has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery. Three other investigators have pursued it in recent years, combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin: Ptolemy, one of Alexander\\u2019s leading generals, committed the murder with arsenic; Rhoxane, the king\\u2019s wife, did it with strychnine; Alexander\\u2019s physicians did it, but by accident, with powdered hellebore root. The last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the New Zealand toxicologist Leo Schep and the Scotland Yard detective John Grieve. These two men were brought together in a 2009 television documentary, Alexander the Great\\u2019s Mysterious Death. Schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore, used medicinally by the ancient Greeks but lethal in large doses, could best account for Alexander\\u2019s recorded symptoms. Grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin, as Schep had supposed, but by Alexander\\u2019s doctors, who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him. Grieve\\u2019s ingenious speculation is only that, but has already won the endorsement of at least one Alexander specialist, the British classicist Richard Stoneman. \\u2018Hellebore, despite its dangers, was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects\\u2019, Stoneman notes. \\u2018But it was easy to get the dose wrong, and Alexander\\u2019s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in Babylon \\u2013 or even misread the Babylonian label.\\u2019 But the toxicology on which Schep and Grieve rely is evidently not an exact science, especially when practiced at a distance of 2,300 years. The author Graham Phillips submitted the same record of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms as Schep\\u2019s to the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Center but obtained a very different answer. In his 2004 book Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon Phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like Alexander\\u2019s. Following a twisting, at times tortuous, trail of logic Phillips tries to identify Alexander\\u2019s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine. The poisonous plant is rare along Alexander\\u2019s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent (modern Pakistan). Not all of Alexander\\u2019s retinue followed him into such areas, allowing Phillips to eliminate potential suspects. He concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill Alexander also had the means: Rhoxane, the first of the king\\u2019s three wives. She had become enraged at Alexander, Phillips assumes, by his two subsequent marriages to Persian princesses and killed him. This view of Rhoxane as a latter-day Medea revives one popularised in the 17th-century English tragedy by Nataniel Lee, The Rival Queens, but is not supported by evidence. (Oliver Stone, too, portrays Rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman, though he makes her guilty of the death of Hephaestion \\u2013 in his view, Alexander\\u2019s male lover \\u2013 rather than Alexander himself.) Arsenic gets the spotlight in a 2004 book, The Death of Alexander the Great by Paul Doherty, novelist and amateur historian. Doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by Plutarch and the Roman writer Quintus Curtius: Alexander\\u2019s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of Babylon for a week or more. Doherty cites toxicology studies of the 19th century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification. However the jury seems to be out on this point and, for obvious reasons, opportunities for field tests are few. If Alexander\\u2019s body really did resist decomposition \\u2013 and some experts consider the story a fiction \\u2013 then numerous explanations have to be considered. Those who believe Alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol. Strychnine, hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents. Defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the non-decay phenomenon: Alexander, in their view, only appeared to die on June 11th; he actually entered a deep coma. He may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him. Doherty\\u2019s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at Ptolemy as its lead suspect. Ptolemy got the best post-Alexander assignment of any of the leading generals, a posting in wealthy Egypt. He eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries, until finally lost by his descendant Cleopatra in 30 BC. Doherty argues backward from Ptolemy\\u2019s later success, reasoning that he who gained the most from Alexander\\u2019s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about. It is the same thinking that Oliver Stone used when he made Ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in Alexander. As the director said in the Berkeley interview: \\u2018I go back to [the film] JFK: Cui bono? Who benefits?\\u2019 It is startling to think that Ptolemy or Rhoxane, two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to Alexander, may have wanted him dead, but those possibilities cannot be ruled out. Neither can Stone\\u2019s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in Alexander\\u2019s murder, at least by not intervening to prevent it (\\u2018By silence we consented\\u2019). Indeed John Atkinson, a South African classicist, has put forward a scenario very much like that of Stone\\u2019s film in a 2009 journal article entitled \\u2018Alexander\\u2019s Last Days: Malaria and Mind Games?\\u2019 (co-authored with two medical specialists, Elsie and Etienne Truter). Like Stone, Atkinson portrays an Alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates. \\u2018The officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap\\u2019, he and his co-authors write. \\u2018Men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger.\\u2019 In Atkinson\\u2019s view the campaigns Alexander had in mind in June 323 BC \\u2013 including conquest of Arabia, Carthage and the entire Mediterranean coast \\u2013 were a bridge too far for Alexander\\u2019s officers. Having turned him back from the East by mutiny, he argues, these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the West. Even while regarding Alexander as a pariah to his own people, Atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned, seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms. His verdict is something closer to euthanasia: after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the \\u2018mind games\\u2019 of the article\\u2019s title. \\u2018The officers in Alexander\\u2019s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive\\u2019, Atkinson writes. \\u2018Maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die.\\u2019 And so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions. Ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever, even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios. Mayor and Hayes raise the possibility that Alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered; John Grieve suspects he was poisoned, but by accident. Atkinson makes the case that Alexander\\u2019s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural, but something in between. If the embalmed body of Alexander is ever found \\u2013 and some researchers continue to hunt for it \\u2013 we may finally learn what caused his death, but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century AD (it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at Alexandria). Meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Justin and Quintus Curtius. Unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots. With physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the Alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories. Opponents of such theories have long noted that Alexander himself, during the 10 or 12 days he slid towards death, never gave any sign that he suspected poison, though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years. He would never have gone willingly to his death (as Oliver Stone\\u2019s film appears to imply), nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him. A slow decline would allow him to order their executions. To assert that Alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled. The same point could be made about what followed Alexander\\u2019s death. The chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination. If the goal of the generals was to \\u2018go home and spend their dough\\u2019, as Oliver Stone asserted in his Berkeley interview, they failed miserably. None ever returned to Macedonia and only Ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security. Many of the others continued fighting and killing each other. Given how central Alexander was to the stability of their world, they had no reason in June 323 BC to expect otherwise. Any plan to poison Alexander would have been fraught with perils, especially for Macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins. Conspiracy theories have to assume that Alexander\\u2019s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything. It is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them: as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king. Thus it is easier, in the end, to believe that Alexander died of disease, despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise. About the Author:\\nJames Romm is James H.

              "'by Jonathan O’Callaghan In 1979, Mark Lijek was working at the US Embassy in Tehran as a consular officer along with his wife, a consular assistant. On 4 November 1979, the embassy was stormed by Iranian protestors, forcing Lijek, his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by Canada and the CIA. At 9am on Sunday 4 November 1979, Mark Lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of Iranian protestors climbed the gate of the US Embassy in Tehran. The attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between Iran and the US, culminating in what would be one of the modern era’s highest-profile hostage crises. As the embassy fell into Iranian hands, however, Lijek and five others, including his wife, would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country. Their incredible story was retold in the Oscar-winning 2012 film Argo, but here Lijek tells us what really happened. Lijek served as a consular officer for the US Embassy in Tehran, while his wife Cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office. “Most of the Americans worked in two buildings; the vast majority were in the Chancellery, which was in the south centre of the compound, and the rest of us worked in the consular annex, which was about a five-minute walk to the northwest,” explains Lijek. “Our compound was very large, 26 acres [10 hectares] and about a mile [1.6 kilometres] of wall, and we had 13 marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing, so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question. The plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue.” It quickly became apparent, though, that rescue was out of the question. “We had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons, locked everything down, and we basically just sat there,” continues Lijek. “We didn’t see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour. Finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building. “Eventually, somebody noticed our building was not fully protected. It was brand new, we had all these latest security upgrades, but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows. They were just normal glass, no bars, no nothing. So somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in, and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder. He pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below. A friend and I grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together, but if they really wanted to break through they could have, and I’m not sure why we were left alone from that point on, but we sort of were.” It became a very nervous wait for Lijek and his colleagues. The electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait, which they did for two hours. “Finally we were told that we should try to get to the British compound,” says Lijek. “There was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go, but given the circumstances we didn’t have much choice.” The marine opened the door and one of Lijek’s friends crept out, finding three policemen who didn’t have any objections to them leaving. The Iranian customers and\\xa0employees in the building had already made a break to get home, leaving just 13 Americans behind. It was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success; the two married couples, Lijek and his wife being one, left in the first group of six with two civilian Americans who were there on business. “I assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first, and in fact that’s how it turned out,” explains Lijek. ”We made it. That second group that left a few minutes after us did not, with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me, this fella Bob Anders, our immigration chief.” In addition to the embassy swarming with protestors, the streets were alive with revolutionaries. ”I was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us,” says Lijek, “and in fact that’s exactly what happened to that second group of Americans. They followed us but we came to the first major north-south street, and we turned south, which was the proper direction to go to the British compound. The second group, which included our boss, the consular general, decided to go to his house and play bridge instead, so they turned north. And apparently that little change in plan got them caught, because they got about 150 yards [135 metres] north and some guy with a G3 [rifle] came running after them, rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy.” Lijek and his group made their way to the British compound through the narrow city streets, but when they got to Ferdowsi Square, which was right in front of the compound, they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path. Ducking into an alley, they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to Anders’ apartment and wait out the trouble. “You have to remember, we’re still thinking all we’ve got to do is hide out for a few hours, we did not know that there would be no rescue,” says Lijek. “So once we got to Bob’s place we were feeling pretty good. We sat around, had a nice lunch, had a few drinks, listened to the BBC describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and we’d be back at work tomorrow.” By 11pm, four of them, Lijek and his wife and the other couple, Joe and Kathy Stafford, made their way to the Iran-America Society to spend the night. The following day they were on the move again, this time finally to the British compound after a brief stop at the Staffords’ apartment, but all the while an uncooperative Washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were. That Monday, 5 November, the British Embassy (separate from the British compound they were in) was attacked. “The compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in,” says Lijek “Frankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it. So London and Washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you.” Lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again. “As it was, we did feel like we’d been abandoned,” he reveals. Virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee, known as a komiteh, and Lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught. The group were moved to a US Embassy house under the care of a Thai cook called Sam, but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper, an elderly Thai lady, was not comfortable with them being there. After a row between Sam and her on 10 November, she left the house in a foul mood, and the Americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence. Fortunately, Anders had been in contact with his Canadian counterpart, John Sheardown, who insisted they join him at his residence at the Canadian Embassy, which hadn’t been touched by the Iranians. At the Sheardown residence they were able to relax, to an extent. As Americans who had been in the US Embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the Iranians would almost certainly hold them captive, along with the 52 other American hostages. The Canadians were extremely welcoming, however, and Prime Minister Joe Clark sanctioned their stay, unbeknown to the Iranians, of course. They would end up remaining there for two months and, while not uncomfortable, it was not without peril. “In terms of specific threats, one really was John’s gardener,” explains Lijek. “He was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us, and that was kind of a problem because John’s house had a lot of glass walls, and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted. There were other little things, like the garbage; John had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house you’ve got seven [an additional member of the group was added, who had been hiding with the Swedes, while the Staffords were in a residence nearby]. The garbage man was also a member of the komiteh, so John had to start carrying the garbage to work. The other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord, so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days. But we didn’t like going outside, we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons. On one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of Iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road. That was really nice of them but, I mean, it was outside of my comfort zone! It’s not that I expected everybody to know my face or whatever, it’s not like they were putting up wanted posters, but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful.” By January, Lijek’s group was getting restless, so they asked the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor to relay a message to Washington asking for help to leave Iran. But it would not be until late January that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out. The CIA had put together a fake science-fiction movie called Argo, complete with posters, a script and press releases, and the plan was to pretend the group were Hollywood employees out in Tehran shooting a movie. ”We didn’t really know anything about the CIA or the specifics of the plan until 26 January when [CIA agent] Tony Mendez and his partner, Julio, came to the house in the evening,” explains Lijek. ”We were briefed on three possible options [for escape]: one of course was the Hollywood scenario, but it was pretty obvious from the way Tony presented them that the other two were throwaways. One, I think, had us as agronomists or something like that, and the other I think we were people involved in a petroleum venture. The Hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility, frankly, because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done? Hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality, it seems, and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime.” Lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan. They were each given roles to play; Lijek was the transportation coordinator for the ‘movie’, his wife the scriptwriter, and so on. They were given new identities, new passports and told to alter their appearance. However, one member of their group, Joe Stafford, did not like the plan at all. “He thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released, which to me made no sense,” says Lijek. Stafford’s refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission. Thankfully, in the morning of 27 January, the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly. Unlike the 2012 movie, their journey to and through the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran was largely uneventful, apart from a brief delay for their plane. There was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed. Indeed, the plan went so well that Lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the Iranians: “What Tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us,” explains Lijek “A professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour, so the thing Tony didn’t want was for us to be nervous, so he needed us to believe in the scenario. We made a game of it, and with the exception of Joe we were having fun.” Aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour, the group ultimately boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich on the morning of Sunday 27 January 1980, finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close. “Once we got out of Iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief,” says Lijek. “We toasted each other and it was an amazing moment. It’s kind of hard to describe, there were just so many different emotions, including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind, but for ourselves it was like magic. I don’t think I’ve ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress, finally it just all of a sudden goes away. It was incredible.” Although they managed to escape relatively trouble free, not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily, and one man who remained uncertain was President Carter, who later said the Argo six’ had just a fifty-fifty chance of successfully leaving Iran. “I’m surprised he would have launched the operation with only a 50 per cent chance of success,” admits Lijek. ”I did ask Tony about that and he denied it, he said he figured we were at least 75-25 in favour, and that’s kind of what I would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in Tehran. “If Tony had told us we had a fifty-fifty chance, I don’t think we would have voted [to go]. One thing I did learn from the [2012 film Argo] was the risk we were running. It didn’t occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a CIA escort, you know we are spies at that point, and so who knows what they would do. That never really occurred to me until the movie came out.” Thankfully, the escape went according to plan, but while Lijek and his group were free in the USA by early 1980, the ordeal was far from over for the 52 other Americans who were still being held hostage in Iran. They would not be freed until a year later, on 20 January 1981, after Iraq invaded and forced Iran to enter negotiations with the US. Had the ‘Argo six’ left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed, on 4 November 1979, it’s almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity. However, they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country, thanks in no small part to the help from Canada, a gesture widely heralded across the United States. Such was Canada’s role alongside the CIA that the rescue of the ‘Argo six’ is now known as the Canadian Caper, and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten. \\xa0 * * * In the year leading up to the uprising, tensions between Iran and the United States had escalated when Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (or ruler) of Iran, was admitted to the US for cancer treatment. In February 1979, he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, leaving a provisional government in place. This government failed to quell the revolution and ultimately, on 4 November 1979, another uprising saw a group of Iranian students take over the US Embassy in Tehran. Although Lijek’s group escaped within a few months, 52 other Americans were held hostage until 20 January 1981, when they were released as a result of Iraq invading Iran in September 1980. The revolution brought to a head tensions between Iran and the US that still continue. * * * 09-00 am ♦\\xa0Storming the walls Iranian protestors climb the walls of the US Embassy in Tehran. 09:15 am ♦\\xa0The protestors storm and take the chancellery at the US Embassy. 9:30 am ♦\\xa0Lijek and his colleagues get their first glimpse of the protestors in the compound. 9:45 am ♦\\xa0Doors smashed in.

embassy was stormed by iranian protestors forcing lijek his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by canada and the cia at  on sunday  november  mark lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of iranian protestors climbed the gate of the us embassy in tehran the attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between iran and the us culminating in what would be one of the modern era\\u2019s highestprofile hostage crises as the embassy fell into iranian hands however lijek and five others including his wife would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country their incredible story was retold in the oscarwinning  film argo but here lijek tells us what really happened lijek served as a consular officer for the us embassy in tehran while his wife cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office \\u201cmost of the americans worked in two buildings the vast majority were in the chancellery which was in the south centre of the compound and the rest of us worked in the consular annex which was about a fiveminute walk to the northwest\\u201d explains lijek \\u201cour compound was very large  acres  and about a mile  of wall and we had  marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question the plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue\\u201d it quickly became apparent though that rescue was out of the question \\u201cwe had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons locked everything down and we basically just sat there\\u201d continues lijek \\u201cwe didn\\u2019t see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building \\u201ceventually somebody noticed our building was not fully protected it was brand new we had all these latest security upgrades but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows they were just normal glass no bars no nothing so somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder he pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below a friend and i grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together but if they really wanted to break through they could have and i\\u2019m not sure why we were left alone from that point on but we sort of were\\u201d it became a very nervous wait for lijek and his colleagues the electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait which they did for two hours \\u201cfinally we were told that we should try to get to the british compound\\u201d says lijek \\u201cthere was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go but given the circumstances we didn\\u2019t have much choice\\u201d the marine opened the door and one of lijek\\u2019s friends crept out finding three policemen who didn\\u2019t have any objections to them leaving the iranian customers and\\u00a0employees in the building had already made a break to get home leaving just  americans behind it was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success the two married couples lijek and his wife being one left in the first group of six with two civilian americans who were there on business \\u201ci assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first and in fact that\\u2019s how it turned out\\u201d explains lijek \\u201dwe made it that second group that left a few minutes after us did not with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me this fella bob anders our immigration chief\\u201d in addition to the embassy swarming with protestors the streets were alive with revolutionaries \\u201di was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us\\u201d says lijek \\u201cand in fact that\\u2019s exactly what happened to that second group of americans they followed us but we came to the first major northsouth street and we turned south which was the proper direction to go to the british compound the second group which included our boss the consular general decided to go to his house and play bridge instead so they turned north and apparently that little change in plan got them caught because they got about  yards  north and some guy with a   came running after them rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy\\u201d lijek and his group made their way to the british compound through the narrow city streets but when they got to ferdowsi square which was right in front of the compound they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path ducking into an alley they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to anders\\u2019 apartment and wait out the trouble \\u201cyou have to remember we\\u2019re still thinking all we\\u2019ve got to do is hide out for a few hours we did not know that there would be no rescue\\u201d says lijek \\u201cso once we got to bob\\u2019s place we were feeling pretty good we sat around had a nice lunch had a few drinks listened to the bbc describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and we\\u2019d be back at work tomorrow\\u201d by  four of them lijek and his wife and the other couple joe and kathy stafford made their way to the iranamerica society to spend the night the following day they were on the move again this time finally to the british compound after a brief stop at the staffords\\u2019 apartment but all the while an uncooperative washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were that monday  november the british embassy separate from the british compound they were in was attacked \\u201cthe compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in\\u201d says lijek \\u201cfrankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it so london and washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you\\u201d lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again \\u201cas it was we did feel like we\\u2019d been abandoned\\u201d he reveals virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee known as a komiteh and lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught the group were moved to a us embassy house under the care of a thai cook called sam but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper an elderly thai lady was not comfortable with them being there after a row between sam and her on  november she left the house in a foul mood and the americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence fortunately anders had been in contact with his canadian counterpart john sheardown who insisted they join him at his residence at the canadian embassy which hadn\\u2019t been touched by the iranians at the sheardown residence they were able to relax to an extent as americans who had been in the us embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the iranians would almost certainly hold them captive along with the  other american hostages the canadians were extremely welcoming however and prime minister joe clark sanctioned their stay unbeknown to the iranians of course they would end up remaining there for two months and while not uncomfortable it was not without peril \\u201cin terms of specific threats one really was john\\u2019s gardener\\u201d explains lijek \\u201che was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us and that was kind of a problem because john\\u2019s house had a lot of glass walls and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted there were other little things like the garbage john had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house you\\u2019ve got seven  the garbage man was also a member of the komiteh so john had to start carrying the garbage to work the other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days but we didn\\u2019t like going outside we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons on one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road that was really nice of them but i mean it was outside of my comfort zone it\\u2019s not that i expected everybody to know my face or whatever it\\u2019s not like they were putting up wanted posters but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful\\u201d by january lijek\\u2019s group was getting restless so they asked the canadian ambassador ken taylor to relay a message to washington asking for help to leave iran but it would not be until late january that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out the cia had put together a fake sciencefiction movie called argo complete with posters a script and press releases and the plan was to pretend the group were hollywood employees out in tehran shooting a movie \\u201dwe didn\\u2019t really know anything about the cia or the specifics of the plan until  january when  tony mendez and his partner julio came to the house in the evening\\u201d explains lijek \\u201dwe were briefed on three possible options  one of course was the hollywood scenario but it was pretty obvious from the way tony presented them that the other two were throwaways one i think had us as agronomists or something like that and the other i think we were people involved in a petroleum venture the hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility frankly because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality it seems and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime\\u201d lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan they were each given roles to play lijek was the transportation coordinator for the \\u2018movie\\u2019 his wife the scriptwriter and so on they were given new identities new passports and told to alter their appearance however one member of their group joe stafford did not like the plan at all \\u201che thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released which to me made no sense\\u201d says lijek stafford\\u2019s refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission thankfully in the morning of  january the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly unlike the  movie their journey to and through the mehrabad airport in tehran was largely uneventful apart from a brief delay for their plane there was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed indeed the plan went so well that lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the iranians \\u201cwhat tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us\\u201d explains lijek \\u201ca professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour so the thing tony didn\\u2019t want was for us to be nervous so he needed us to believe in the scenario we made a game of it and with the exception of joe we were having fun\\u201d aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour the group ultimately boarded a swissair flight to zurich on the morning of sunday  january  finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close \\u201conce we got out of iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief\\u201d says lijek \\u201cwe toasted each other and it was an amazing moment it\\u2019s kind of hard to describe there were just so many different emotions including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind but for ourselves it was like magic i don\\u2019t think i\\u2019ve ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress finally it just all of a sudden goes away it was incredible\\u201d although they managed to escape relatively trouble free not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily and one man who remained uncertain was president carter who later said the argo six\\u2019 had just a fiftyfifty chance of successfully leaving iran \\u201ci\\u2019m surprised he would have launched the operation with only a  per cent chance of success\\u201d admits lijek \\u201di did ask tony about that and he denied it he said he figured we were at least  in favour and that\\u2019s kind of what i would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in tehran \\u201cif tony had told us we had a fiftyfifty chance i don\\u2019t think we would have voted  one thing i did learn from the  was the risk we were running it didn\\u2019t occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a cia escort you know we are spies at that point and so who knows what they would do that never really occurred to me until the movie came out\\u201d thankfully the escape went according to plan but while lijek and his group were free in the usa by early  the ordeal was far from over for the  other americans who were still being held hostage in iran they would not be freed until a year later on  january  after iraq invaded and forced iran to enter negotiations with the us had the \\u2018argo six\\u2019 left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed on  november  it\\u2019s almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity however they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country thanks in no small part to the help from canada a gesture widely heralded across the united states such was canada\\u2019s role alongside the cia that the rescue of the \\u2018argo six\\u2019 is now known as the canadian caper and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten \\u00a0    in the year leading up to the uprising tensions between iran and the united states had escalated when mohammad reza shah pahlavi the shah or ruler of iran was admitted to the us for cancer treatment in february  he was overthrown

napoleon bonaparte was everything a military genius politician jurist and creative talent supported by unparalleled dynamism he lent his name to ambition and did so in a minimal amount of time in the handful of years between austerlitz and waterloo he took the world when defeated he had marked it forever then from the exile of saint helena he soared into legend it all began on another island

the art of war it was five years of study and reading and also of taunts his classmates didn\\u2019t forgive his corsican origin and his halting french napoleon emerged with a quarrelsome and solitary disposition and a strong spirit of revenge pride bolstered by a bitter antifrench resentment his military career progressed rapidly in  he moved to the royal school of paris and at just sixteen years old he was assigned to an artillery regiment stationed at la f\\u00e8re in picardy when the revolution broke out in  napoleon joined and obtained a leave to return to corsica hoping the new upheavals could benefit the island\\u2019s cause however he had to flee in  with his family after breaking with the independence front in paris the revolution had already led to the reign of terror and the

by the english had entrenched themselves the young officer brilliantly resolved the city\\u2019s siege exhibiting artillery force management that already revealed the genius strategist a success that earned him the rank of brigade general and the attention of future directory member paul barras who two years later on october   appointed him commander of the paris garrison napoleon saved the

innovative management of troops meticulous preparation of battles selection of officers as courageous and bold as him and the ability to revitalize the army by instilling a common sentiment that becomes a shared dream of glory when the bond between troop and leader solidifies into fanatic devotion to the commander in italy napoleon discovered he had greatness equal to his ambition and he began to serve both on august  at castiglione delle stiviere he won his first major field battle pushing to venice and forcing austria to the treaty of campoformio crowned with the laurel of the victor he became politically cumbersome in france the directory preferred to distance him from paris by entrusting him with the occupation of egypt aimed at countering british economic interests in the seas the campaign was a failure despite the victorious battle of the pyramids fought on july   the commander had to witness the complete destruction of the fleet by the hands of english admiral horatio nelson and surrender to the impossibility of taking the ancient crusader fortress of saint john of acre returning home he found the directory in crisis and the army in tatters there was no choice but a coup on november   according to the revolutionary calendar  brumaire bonaparte dissolved the chambers power passed to three consuls who introduced a new constitution then ratified by a plebiscite appointed first consul the general had the country in his hands and shaped it on a model of strong administrative centralization the country was divided into departments with the new figure of the prefect at the helm he also resolved the longstanding dispute with the church signing the concordat that established the state\\u2019s secularity he founded the national bank and reorganized the educational system including the lyc\\u00e9e the forge of the new ruling class but if france was his italy was slipping away the second antifrench coalition had overturned some of the republics

defeated frederick william ii\\u2019s prussia at jena and made his triumphant entrance into berlin in  at friedland the army of tsar alexander capitulated practically unbeatable leading an army drunk with success the emperor now imposed the continental blockade forbidding ships flying the english flag from docking at any port thus hoping to bend the british economy to the pope who refused to adhere he responded with the capture of rome and the annexation of the papal states to the empire and when the excommunication bull arrived he had the pontiff arrested who was then transferred to france first to grenoble and then to fontainebleau the blockade however was a failure too many states circumvented it including portugal which was invaded in retaliation napoleon then took advantage of the dynastic dispute between charles iv and his son to force both to abdicate and place his brother joseph on the throne of spain without however managing to tame the guerrillas or even to annihilate the english expeditionary force that in the meantime had liberated the lusitanian state despite the difficulties in  he also bent the fifth coalition yet another alliance between the austrian empire and the united kingdom defeated from a position of undisputed military superiority he occupied vienna and the sch\\u00f6nbrunn castle and dictated a harsh peace to the austrians meanwhile he agreed with their prime minister metternich on a state marriage capable of definitively reconciling france and austria and hopefully of granting the emperor the longedfor male heir he had divorced josephine his beloved but unfaithful companion and now married maria luisa of austria niece of marie antoinette but the son born in  napoleon francis known as the king of rome would never ascend the throne and would die at just  years old determined to strike a final blow against tsar alexander the emperor attempted the invasion of russia a titanic endeavor that ended in an epochal defeat the numbers don\\u2019t lie the emperor set off at the head of an army of  men of which over  would never return the defeat gave rise to the european powers napoleon back in france worked night and day to rebuild the army about  strong largely young recruits the wounded old lion was enough to keep the prussians at bay but not the bulk of the coalition including the austrians who did not seem to greatly respect the previous year\\u2019s marriage the french army capitulated at leipzig napoleon entrusted the regency to his wife and the capital to his brother then took the lead of  veterans and for two months kept the enemy forces at bay eventually yielding to the prussians on march   tsar alexander entered paris napoleon was forced to abdicate after an attempted suicide with arsenic miraculously thwarted and a moving farewell to the old guard he reached marseille and sailed for his exile on elba on the island he vented his hyperactivity by building roads and infrastructure and kept a watchful eye on paris where louis xviii back on the throne after his abdication had already alienated the favor of the people fleeing from elba to the legendary \\u2018hundred days\\u2019 ten months of confinement were enough he escaped british surveillance and on march   landed at antibes the legendary \\u2018hundred days\\u2019 began marching towards paris he raised unexpected popular enthusiasm his mere appearance was enough to persuade the troops sent against him by the king to mutiny back on the throne he reorganized the army and promulgated a more liberal constitution the final duel awaited him he faced his usual enemies with the united kingdom and prussia at the forefront he still planned to divide the predominant opposing forces but the maneuver only partially succeeded waterloo would be the last chapter of the inimitable military history of the fabulous corsican tactical and organizational errors would decree the historic defeat of june   also weighed down by the choice of generals not up to the task having found refuge in the ch\\u00e2teau de malmaison napoleon awaited his fate on july  he surrendered to the british convinced he could live as a private citizen in england or the united states he instead faced life imprisonment on the remote island of saint helena in the atlantic ocean on that speck of land closely watched by a british contingent the man who had been master of europe died on may   at  struck down by stomach cancer buried on the island his body was only returned to paris for a solemn funeral in  since  he rests in a monumental tomb in the church of saintlouis des invalides the greatest legacy the napoleonic code\\nduring his exile on the island of saint helena following the defeat at waterloo napoleon often emphasized that his

civil procedure in  and the commercial code in  \\u2013 it was the first modern civil code of which napoleon was not only the inspirer and promoter but also shared in its drafting entrusted to four

inbox\",\n          \"in his article james romm explores the enduring mystery surrounding the death of alexander the great in  bc an event that has baffled historians and sparked numerous theories over the centuries despite his robust health and seemingly divine status alexander\\u2019s sudden death at  in babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the wars of the successors while some historians suggest natural causes like disease others propose theories of murder fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death oliver stone\\u2019s film alexander reignited interest in these theories suggesting a conspiracy among alexander\\u2019s generals various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians despite extensive historical forensic and toxicological research including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with alexander\\u2019s symptoms the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation leaving one of history\\u2019s greatest mysteries unsolved by james romm in babylon on june   bc at about  alexander the great died aged  having conquered an empire stretching from modern albania to eastern pakistan the question of what or who killed the macedonian king has never been answered successfully today new theories are heating up one of history\\u2019s longestrunning cold cases like the death of stalin to which it is sometimes compared the death of alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king\\u2019s body was cold but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects fuel was added to the fire by oliver stone\\u2018s alexander released in  with new versions in  and  a film that whatever its artistic flaws presents a historically informed theory about who killed alexander and why few events have been as unexpected as the death of alexander the king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his  campaign through asia enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles some had come to think of him as divine an idea fostered and perhaps entertained by alexander himself in  fighting almost singlehanded against south asian warriors alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches a  trek along the barren coast of southern iran consequently when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later the shock felt by his  army was intense so was the confusion about who would next lead it for alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir though one would be born shortly after his death the sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point the start of a halfcentury of instability and strife known today as the wars of the successors events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes it is disturbing to think that blind chance \\u2013 a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito \\u2013 put the ancient world on a perilous new course an explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring even though it involves a darker view of alexander\\u2019s relations with his companions the inner circle of friends and highranking officers that surrounded him in babylon ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of alexander\\u2019s death though many attribute it to disease in  eugene borza a scholar specialising in ancient macedon took part in a medical board of inquiry at the university of maryland which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever borza has since defended that finding in print malaria smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed with alcoholism infection from the lung wound and grief \\u2013 alexander\\u2019s close friend hephaestion had died some months earlier \\u2013 often seen as complicating factors but some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness or even to choose between illness or murder two alexander experts who once made this choice one on each side later changed their opinions to undecided with historical research at an impasse alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology they are reopening the alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation the idea that alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in  thanks to the ending of stone\\u2019s film in its epilogue alexander\\u2019s senior general ptolemy played by anthony hopkins looking back over decades at his commander\\u2019s death declares \\u2018the truth is we did kill him by silence we consented \\u2026 because we couldn\\u2019t go on\\u2019 ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again \\u2018you shall write he died of disease and in weakened condition\\u2019 the idea that alexander\\u2019s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of stone\\u2019s famously plotprone imagination there is some evidence that not even alexander\\u2019s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere in india in  bc at the eastern edge of the indus river system alexander\\u2019s army staged a sitdown strike when ordered to march eastward towards the ganges even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy since alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death \\u2018i can\\u2019t believe that these men were going on with alexander\\u2019 to arabia and carthage he said in a  interview at the university of california berkeley stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that ptolemy masterminded a coverup of alexander\\u2019s murder but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed the account ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the royal journals though now lost it was summarised in different versions by arrian and plutarch two greek writers of the roman empire who endorsed it as the most reliable record of alexander\\u2019s last days some scholars led by the australian classicist brian bosworth believe the royal journals were falsified to make alexander\\u2019s death appear natural just as stone\\u2019s film represents though in bosworth\\u2019s view the culprit was eumenes alexander\\u2019s court secretary rather than ptolemy others disagree taking the journals to be just what arrian and plutarch thought they were an undoctored daybyday eyewitness account       the debate over the royal journals has huge implications for our understanding of alexander\\u2019s death because arrian and plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources both authors say that alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named medius his fever grew worse over the course of  or  days the two accounts differ in chronology leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak as his troops shuffled past his sickbed arrian reports alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one death followed the next day but a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that stone followed in alexander in this alternate version alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and more importantly just as he drained a huge cup of wine these accounts say that alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud from that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms including great pain convulsions and delirium but they say little or nothing about fever the keynote of the plutarch and arrian accounts a stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison which is why plutarch in his biography of alexander vehemently denied that it had occurred \\u2018some writers think they have to say such things as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama\\u2019 he sneered apparently the dispute between those who thought alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder \\u2013 essentially those who did or did not trust the royal journals \\u2013 was already rife in plutarch\\u2019s day probably all reports of alexander\\u2019s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely for supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is of course \\u2018whodunnit\\u2019 stone\\u2019s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question in the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the companions to show that they know alexander\\u2019s cup contains poison but no clue is given as to how it got there by contrast many greek and roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it but how and with what poison with remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at antipater the senior general whom alexander had left in charge of the macedonian homeland and at two of his sons cassander and iollas antipater may indeed have had reason to want alexander dead in the spring of  bc for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to babylon perhaps with hostile intent antipater stayed put but sent cassander in his stead according to several ancient accounts antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water collected from the legendary river styx believed to flow above ground in the northern peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld the water had to be transported in a hollowedout mule\\u2019s hoof for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn in babylon ran the story cassander passed this mule\\u2019s hoof to his brother iollas \\u2013 conveniently enough alexander\\u2019s winepourer \\u2013 who then slipped the toxin into the king\\u2019s drink the basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling but details vary some versions mention the philosopher aristotle as a coconspirator he was a known friend of antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student alexander who had sanctioned the death of his relative callisthenes others make medius the host of the final fatal dinner party and allegedly iollas\\u2019 male lover a participant in the plot one very early version published in an anonymous greek pamphlet now known as the last days and testament of alexander made iollas doubly guilty when the first draught of poison failed to kill alexander iollas administered a second soaking in styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit until recently historians dismissed the story of the styx waterpoisoning as a fiction possibly a political smear designed to harm antipater and cassander both were contestants for power in the era after alexander\\u2019s death and had many enemies especially olympias alexander\\u2019s vengeful mother who perhaps to help foster the idea of antipater\\u2019s family\\u2019s guilt eventually had iollas\\u2019 grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind even the idea that ordinary greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd in  the distinguished classicist jg frazer declared that the waters the greeks identified as the styx today called blackwater or mavroneri contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century but in a presentation at a conference in barcelona in  the historian adrienne mayor and the toxicologist antoinette hayes proposed that the limestone around mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today though they may have disappeared over the centuries mayor and hayes argue that \\u2018calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for alexander\\u2019 \\u2013 including his high fever usually seen as proof of a natural death the research of mayor and hayes might suggest that alexander was murdered though the authors themselves stop short of that claim they are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself their thesis that the styx really was strongly toxic would account for why antipater and his sons were the ancient world\\u2019s prime suspects cassander\\u2019s journey from europe to babylon just a few weeks before the onset of alexander\\u2019s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which styx water could have arrived at the king\\u2019s banquet table cassander later helped confirm the ancient world\\u2019s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of macedonia and executing alexander\\u2019s mother wife and son the authors are also interested in how in the greek imagination the mythic resonance of the styx a river thought able to stupefy even the gods made it an ideal weapon for antipater and his sons to use \\u2018such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to alexander\\u2019 mayor said recently \\u2018an ordinary common drug would not do only a very rare potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for alexander\\u2019 it remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of antipater\\u2019s conspiracy can help crack the mystery but it is clear that the mayorhayes approach matching toxins available to the ancient world with alexander\\u2019s reported symptoms has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery three other investigators have pursued it in recent years combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin ptolemy one of alexander\\u2019s leading generals committed the murder with arsenic rhoxane the king\\u2019s wife did it with strychnine alexander\\u2019s physicians did it but by accident with powdered hellebore root the last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the new zealand toxicologist leo schep and the scotland yard detective john grieve these two men were brought together in a  television documentary alexander the great\\u2019s mysterious death schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore used medicinally by the ancient greeks but lethal in large doses could best account for alexander\\u2019s recorded symptoms grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin as schep had supposed but by alexander\\u2019s doctors who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him grieve\\u2019s ingenious speculation is only that but has already won the endorsement of at least one alexander specialist the british classicist richard stoneman \\u2018hellebore despite its dangers was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects\\u2019 stoneman notes \\u2018but it was easy to get the dose wrong and alexander\\u2019s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in babylon \\u2013 or even misread the babylonian label\\u2019 but the toxicology on which schep and grieve rely is evidently not an exact science especially when practiced at a distance of  years the author graham phillips submitted the same record of alexander\\u2019s symptoms as schep\\u2019s to the los angeles county regional poison center but obtained a very different answer in his  book alexander the great murder in babylon phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like alexander\\u2019s following a twisting at times tortuous trail of logic phillips tries to identify alexander\\u2019s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine the poisonous plant is rare along alexander\\u2019s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent modern pakistan not all of alexander\\u2019s retinue followed him into such areas allowing phillips to eliminate potential suspects he concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill alexander also had the means rhoxane the first of the king\\u2019s three wives she had become enraged at alexander phillips assumes by his two subsequent marriages to persian princesses and killed him this view of rhoxane as a latterday medea revives one popularised in the  english tragedy by nataniel lee the rival queens but is not supported by evidence oliver stone too portrays rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman though he makes her guilty of the death of hephaestion \\u2013 in his view alexander\\u2019s male lover \\u2013 rather than alexander himself arsenic gets the spotlight in a  book the death of alexander the great by paul doherty novelist and amateur historian doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by plutarch and the roman writer quintus curtius alexander\\u2019s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of babylon for a week or more doherty cites toxicology studies of the  century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification however the jury seems to be out on this point and for obvious reasons opportunities for field tests are few if alexander\\u2019s body really did resist decomposition \\u2013 and some experts consider the story a fiction \\u2013 then numerous explanations have to be considered those who believe alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol strychnine hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the nondecay phenomenon alexander in their view only appeared to die on june  he actually entered a deep coma he may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him doherty\\u2019s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at ptolemy as its lead suspect ptolemy got the best postalexander assignment of any of the leading generals a posting in wealthy egypt he eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries until finally lost by his descendant cleopatra in  bc doherty argues backward from ptolemy\\u2019s later success reasoning that he who gained the most from alexander\\u2019s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about it is the same thinking that oliver stone used when he made ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in alexander as the director said in the berkeley interview \\u2018i go back to  jfk cui bono who benefits\\u2019 it is startling to think that ptolemy or rhoxane two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to alexander may have wanted him dead but those possibilities cannot be ruled out neither can stone\\u2019s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in alexander\\u2019s murder at least by not intervening to prevent it \\u2018by silence we consented\\u2019 indeed john atkinson a south african classicist has put forward a scenario very much like that of stone\\u2019s film in a  journal article entitled \\u2018alexander\\u2019s last days malaria and mind games\\u2019 coauthored with two medical specialists elsie and etienne truter like stone atkinson portrays an alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates \\u2018the officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap\\u2019 he and his coauthors write \\u2018men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger\\u2019 in atkinson\\u2019s view the campaigns alexander had in mind in june  bc \\u2013 including conquest of arabia carthage and the entire mediterranean coast \\u2013 were a bridge too far for alexander\\u2019s officers having turned him back from the east by mutiny he argues these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the west even while regarding alexander as a pariah to his own people atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms his verdict is something closer to euthanasia after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the \\u2018mind games\\u2019 of the article\\u2019s title \\u2018the officers in alexander\\u2019s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive\\u2019 atkinson writes \\u2018maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die\\u2019 and so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios mayor and hayes raise the possibility that alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered john grieve suspects he was poisoned but by accident atkinson makes the case that alexander\\u2019s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural but something in between if the embalmed body of alexander is ever found \\u2013 and some researchers continue to hunt for it \\u2013 we may finally learn what caused his death but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century ad it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at alexandria meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by plutarch arrian diodorus justin and quintus curtius unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots with physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories opponents of such theories have long noted that alexander himself during the  or  days he slid towards death never gave any sign that he suspected poison though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years he would never have gone willingly to his death as oliver stone\\u2019s film appears to imply nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him a slow decline would allow him to order their executions to assert that alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled the same point could be made about what followed alexander\\u2019s death the chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination if the goal of the generals was to \\u2018go home and spend their dough\\u2019 as oliver stone asserted in his berkeley interview they failed miserably none ever returned to macedonia and only ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security many of the others continued fighting and killing each other given how central alexander was to the stability of their world they had no reason in june  bc to expect otherwise any plan to poison alexander would have been fraught with perils especially for macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins conspiracy theories have to assume that alexander\\u2019s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything it is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king thus it is easier in the end to believe that alexander died of disease despite ingenious and determined recent

stormed by iranian protestors forcing lijek his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by canada and the cia at  on sunday  november  mark lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of iranian protestors climbed the gate of the us embassy in tehran the attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between iran and the us culminating in what would be one of the modern eras highestprofile hostage crises as the embassy fell into iranian hands however lijek and five others including his wife would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country their incredible story was retold in the oscarwinning  film argo but here lijek tells us what really happened lijek served as a consular officer for the us embassy in tehran while his wife cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office most of the americans worked in two buildings the vast majority were in the chancellery which was in the south centre of the compound and the rest of us worked in the consular annex which was about a fiveminute walk to the northwest explains lijek our compound was very large  acres  and about a mile  of wall and we had  marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question the plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue it quickly became apparent though that rescue was out of the question we had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons locked everything down and we basically just sat there continues lijek we didnt see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building eventually somebody noticed our building was not fully protected it was brand new we had all these latest security upgrades but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows they were just normal glass no bars no nothing so somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder he pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below a friend and i grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together but if they really wanted to break through they could have and im not sure why we were left alone from that point on but we sort of were it became a very nervous wait for lijek and his colleagues the electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait which they did for two hours finally we were told that we should try to get to the british compound says lijek there was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go but given the circumstances we didnt have much choice the marine opened the door and one of lijeks friends crept out finding three policemen who didnt have any objections to them leaving the iranian customers and\\u00a0employees in the building had already made a break to get home leaving just  americans behind it was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success the two married couples lijek and his wife being one left in the first group of six with two civilian americans who were there on business i assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first and in fact thats how it turned out explains lijek we made it that second group that left a few minutes after us did not with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me this fella bob anders our immigration chief in addition to the embassy swarming with protestors the streets were alive with revolutionaries i was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us says lijek and in fact thats exactly what happened to that second group of americans they followed us but we came to the first major northsouth street and we turned south which was the proper direction to go to the british compound the second group which included our boss the consular general decided to go to his house and play bridge instead so they turned north and apparently that little change in plan got them caught because they got about  yards  north and some guy with a   came running after them rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy lijek and his group made their way to the british compound through the narrow city streets but when they got to ferdowsi square which was right in front of the compound they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path ducking into an alley they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to anders apartment and wait out the trouble you have to remember were still thinking all weve got to do is hide out for a few hours we did not know that there would be no rescue says lijek so once we got to bobs place we were feeling pretty good we sat around had a nice lunch had a few drinks listened to the bbc describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and wed be back at work tomorrow by  four of them lijek and his wife and the other couple joe and kathy stafford made their way to the iranamerica society to spend the night the following day they were on the move again this time finally to the british compound after a brief stop at the staffords apartment but all the while an uncooperative washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were that monday  november the british embassy separate from the british compound they were in was attacked the compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in says lijek frankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it so london and washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again as it was we did feel like wed been abandoned he reveals virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee known as a komiteh and lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught the group were moved to a us embassy house under the care of a thai cook called sam but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper an elderly thai lady was not comfortable with them being there after a row between sam and her on  november she left the house in a foul mood and the americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence fortunately anders had been in contact with his canadian counterpart john sheardown who insisted they join him at his residence at the canadian embassy which hadnt been touched by the iranians at the sheardown residence they were able to relax to an extent as americans who had been in the us embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the iranians would almost certainly hold them captive along with the  other american hostages the canadians were extremely welcoming however and prime minister joe clark sanctioned their stay unbeknown to the iranians of course they would end up remaining there for two months and while not uncomfortable it was not without peril in terms of specific threats one really was johns gardener explains lijek he was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us and that was kind of a problem because johns house had a lot of glass walls and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted there were other little things like the garbage john had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house youve got seven  the garbage man was also a member of the komiteh so john had to start carrying the garbage to work the other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days but we didnt like going outside we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons on one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road that was really nice of them but i mean it was outside of my comfort zone its not that i expected everybody to know my face or whatever its not like they were putting up wanted posters but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful by january lijeks group was getting restless so they asked the canadian ambassador ken taylor to relay a message to washington asking for help to leave iran but it would not be until late january that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out the cia had put together a fake sciencefiction movie called argo complete with posters a script and press releases and the plan was to pretend the group were hollywood employees out in tehran shooting a movie we didnt really know anything about the cia or the specifics of the plan until  january when  tony mendez and his partner julio came to the house in the evening explains lijek we were briefed on three possible options  one of course was the hollywood scenario but it was pretty obvious from the way tony presented them that the other two were throwaways one i think had us as agronomists or something like that and the other i think we were people involved in a petroleum venture the hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility frankly because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality it seems and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan they were each given roles to play lijek was the transportation coordinator for the movie his wife the scriptwriter and so on they were given new identities new passports and told to alter their appearance however one member of their group joe stafford did not like the plan at all he thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released which to me made no sense says lijek staffords refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission thankfully in the morning of  january the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly unlike the  movie their journey to and through the mehrabad airport in tehran was largely uneventful apart from a brief delay for their plane there was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed indeed the plan went so well that lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the iranians what tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us explains lijek a professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour so the thing tony didnt want was for us to be nervous so he needed us to believe in the scenario we made a game of it and with the exception of joe we were having fun aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour the group ultimately boarded a swissair flight to zurich on the morning of sunday  january  finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close once we got out of iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief says lijek we toasted each other and it was an amazing moment its kind of hard to describe there were just so many different emotions including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind but for ourselves it was like magic i dont think ive ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress finally it just all of a sudden goes away it was incredible although they managed to escape relatively trouble free not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily and one man who remained uncertain was president carter who later said the argo six had just a fiftyfifty chance of successfully leaving iran im surprised he would have launched the operation with only a  per cent chance of success admits lijek i did ask tony about that and he denied it he said he figured we were at least  in favour and thats kind of what i would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in tehran if tony had told us we had a fiftyfifty chance i dont think we would have voted  one thing i did learn from the  was the risk we were running it didnt occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a cia escort you know we are spies at that point and so who knows what they would do that never really occurred to me until the movie came out thankfully the escape went according to plan but while lijek and his group were free in the usa by early  the ordeal was far from over for the  other americans who were still being held hostage in iran they would not be freed until a year later on  january  after iraq invaded and forced iran to enter negotiations with the us had the argo six left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed on  november  its almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity however they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country thanks in no small part to the help from canada a gesture widely heralded across the united states such was canadas role alongside the cia that the rescue of the argo six is now known as the canadian caper and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten \\u00a0    in the year leading up to the uprising tensions between iran and the united states had escalated when mohammad reza shah pahlavi the shah or ruler of iran was admitted to the us for cancer treatment in february  he was overthrown in the iranian revolution leaving a provisional government in place this government failed to quell the revolution and ultimately on  november  another uprising saw a group of iranian students take over the us embassy in tehran although lijeks group escaped within a few

mario galloni from an artillery officer to a general then king and finally emperor napoleon bonaparte was everything a military genius politician jurist and creative talent supported by unparalleled dynamism he lent his name to ambition and did so in a minimal amount of time in the handful of years between austerlitz and waterloo he took the world when defeated he had marked it forever then from the exile of saint helena he soared into legend it all began on another island corsica where the future general was born on august   in ajaccio to a family of ancient and noble tuscan origins his father giuseppe maria buonaparte a lawyer and his mother maria letizia ramolino a descendant of a wealthy italian family at ten a scholarship opened the doors to the exclusive military school of briennelech\\u00e2teau in northern france where the offspring of high lineage learned the art of war it was five years of study and reading and also of taunts his classmates didnt forgive his corsican origin and his halting french napoleon emerged with a quarrelsome and solitary disposition and a strong spirit of revenge pride bolstered by a bitter antifrench resentment his military career progressed rapidly in  he moved to the royal school of paris and at just sixteen years old he was assigned to an artillery regiment stationed at la f\\u00e8re in picardy when the revolution broke out in  napoleon joined and obtained a leave to return to corsica hoping the new upheavals could benefit the islands cause however he had to flee in  with his family after breaking with the independence front in paris the revolution had already led to the reign of terror and the guillotine was in full swing appointed captain he was sent by the committee of public health to suppress dissent in marseille later taking command of the troops in toulon where monarchists supported by the english had entrenched themselves the young officer brilliantly resolved the citys siege exhibiting artillery force management that already revealed the genius strategist a success that earned him the rank of brigade general and the attention of future directory member paul barras who two years later on october   appointed him commander of the paris garrison napoleon saved the national convention by quelling the royalist uprising in blood he was named general of the army corps of the interior at only  years old he was a rapidly rising star marriage to josephine and the italian triumphs in the capital the young corsican met the high society he went to the theater organized dinners and stepped into the influential salons he was captivated by the charm of josephine tasher widow beauharnais a great lady with a thousand connections older than him in debt but still the owner of a rich income she bet on the magneticeyed soldier he on a refined woman capable of polishing his manners on march   he married her and on the  of the same month was already in nice commanding the army of italy ready to battle austria the leader of the coalition among the major european monarchies terrified by the specter of the revolutionary plague the campaign began on april  on may  napoleon entered milan as a conqueror in just over a month the young military man having delivered to legend took everyone by surprise by attacking from liguria dividing the enemy front and routing first the piedmontese and then the austrians of the old general beaulieu literally at the mercy of the rivals strategic choices leading an exhausted poorly paid scarcely equipped outnumbered army napoleon accomplished his first masterpiece built on the innovative management of troops meticulous preparation of battles selection of officers as courageous and bold as him and the ability to revitalize the army by instilling a common sentiment that becomes a shared dream of glory when the bond between troop and leader solidifies into fanatic devotion to the commander in italy napoleon discovered he had greatness equal to his ambition and he began to serve both on august  at castiglione delle stiviere he won his first major field battle pushing to venice and forcing austria to the treaty of campoformio crowned with the laurel of the victor he became politically cumbersome in france the directory preferred to distance him from paris by entrusting him with the occupation of egypt aimed at countering british economic interests in the seas the campaign was a failure despite the victorious battle of the pyramids fought on july   the commander had to witness the complete destruction of the fleet by the hands of english admiral horatio nelson and surrender to the impossibility of taking the ancient crusader fortress of saint john of acre returning home he found the directory in crisis and the army in tatters there was no choice but a coup on november   according to the revolutionary calendar  brumaire bonaparte dissolved the chambers power passed to three consuls who introduced a new constitution then ratified by a plebiscite appointed first consul the general had the country in his hands and shaped it on a model of strong administrative centralization the country was divided into departments with the new figure of the prefect at the helm he also resolved the longstanding dispute with the church signing the concordat that established the states secularity he founded the national bank and reorganized the educational system including the lyc\\u00e9e the forge of the new ruling class but if france was his italy was slipping away the second antifrench coalition had overturned some of the republics born from the first expedition so the first consul returned to war and victory first at montebello and then at marengo on june   from the triumph was born in  the italian republic of which bonaparte became president while the treaty of amiens signed with the united kingdom granted two years of respite to europe at notredame in  napoleon received from pope pius vii the crown of french emperor the following year in milan in the duomo he placed the iron crown of king of italy on his head french emperor and king of italy at the height of glory and power he targeted england but the planned invasion of the island clashed with the disproportion of naval forces and foundered after the annihilation of the fleet at trafalgar by nelson in  napoleon faced the third antifrench coalition which this time involved england austria and russia sending his most valiant marshal andrea massena to disturb the austrians in italy while he personally took command of the grande arm\\u00e9e it was the eve of austerlitz bonapartes strategic masterpiece on december   on the anniversary of his coronation he defeated the austrorussians the following year he also defeated frederick william iis prussia at jena and made his triumphant entrance into berlin in  at friedland the army of tsar alexander capitulated practically unbeatable leading an army drunk with success the emperor now imposed the continental blockade forbidding ships flying the english flag from docking at any port thus hoping to bend the british economy to the pope who refused to adhere he responded with the capture of rome and the annexation of the papal states to the empire and when the excommunication bull arrived he had the pontiff arrested who was then transferred to france first to grenoble and then to fontainebleau the blockade however was a failure too many states circumvented it including portugal which was invaded in retaliation napoleon then took advantage of the dynastic dispute between charles iv and his son to force both to abdicate and place his brother joseph on the throne of spain without however managing to tame the guerrillas or even to annihilate the english expeditionary force that in the meantime had liberated the lusitanian state despite the difficulties in  he also bent the fifth coalition yet another alliance between the austrian empire and the united kingdom defeated from a position of undisputed military superiority he occupied vienna and the sch\\u00f6nbrunn castle and dictated a harsh peace to the austrians meanwhile he agreed with their prime minister metternich on a state marriage capable of definitively reconciling france and austria and hopefully of granting the emperor the longedfor male heir he had divorced josephine his beloved but unfaithful companion and now married maria luisa of austria niece of marie antoinette but the son born in  napoleon francis known as the king of rome would never ascend the throne and would die at just  years old determined to strike a final blow against tsar alexander the emperor attempted the invasion of russia a titanic endeavor that ended in an epochal defeat the numbers dont lie the emperor set off at the head of an army of  men of which over  would never return the defeat gave rise to the european powers napoleon back in france worked night and day to rebuild the army about  strong largely young recruits the wounded old lion was enough to keep the prussians at bay but not the bulk of the coalition including the austrians who did not seem to greatly respect the previous years marriage the french army capitulated at leipzig napoleon entrusted the regency to his wife and the capital to his brother then took the lead of  veterans and for two months kept the enemy forces at bay eventually yielding to the prussians on march   tsar alexander entered paris napoleon was forced to abdicate after an attempted suicide with arsenic miraculously thwarted and a moving farewell to the old guard he reached marseille and sailed for his exile on elba on the island he vented his hyperactivity by building roads and infrastructure and kept a watchful eye on paris where louis xviii back on the throne after his abdication had already alienated the favor of the people fleeing from elba to the legendary hundred days ten months of confinement were enough he escaped british surveillance and on march   landed at antibes the legendary hundred days began marching towards paris he raised unexpected popular enthusiasm his mere appearance was enough to persuade the troops sent against him by the king to mutiny back on the throne he reorganized the army and promulgated a more liberal constitution the final duel awaited him he faced his usual enemies with the united kingdom and prussia at the forefront he still planned to divide the predominant opposing forces but the maneuver only partially succeeded waterloo would be the last chapter of the inimitable military history of the fabulous corsican tactical and organizational errors would decree the historic defeat of june   also weighed down by the choice of generals not up to the task having found refuge in the ch\\u00e2teau de malmaison napoleon awaited his fate on july  he surrendered to the british convinced he could live as a private citizen in england or the united states he instead faced life imprisonment on the remote island of saint helena in the atlantic ocean on that speck of land closely watched by a british contingent the man who had been master of europe died on may   at  struck down by stomach cancer buried on the island his body was only returned to paris for a solemn funeral in  since  he rests in a monumental tomb in the church of saintlouis des invalides the greatest legacy the napoleonic codeduring his exile on the island of saint helena following the defeat at waterloo napoleon often emphasized that his most important work the one that would go down in history more than his military victories would be the napoleonic code he was right promulgated in  laws on march   \\u2013 followed by the code of civil procedure in  and the commercial code in  \\u2013 it was the first modern civil code of which napoleon was not only the inspirer and promoter but also shared in its drafting entrusted to four great jurists it is thanks to napoleon who lacked legal knowledge that the code is noted for its particular clarity still in force in france and belgium and a model for the italian and spanish codes the napoleonic code confirmed the major achievements of the french revolution while distancing itself from the excesses of the legislation from  legal equality before the law religious freedom the right to private property and the secularism of the state putting an end to the legacies of the

week directly to your inbox\",\n          \"in his article james romm explores the enduring mystery surrounding the death of alexander the great in  bc an event that has baffled historians and sparked numerous theories over the centuries despite his robust health and seemingly divine status alexanders sudden death at  in babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the wars of the successors while some historians suggest natural causes like disease others propose theories of murder fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death oliver stones film alexander reignited interest in these theories suggesting a conspiracy among alexanders generals various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians despite extensive historical forensic and toxicological research including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with alexanders symptoms the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation leaving one of historys greatest mysteries unsolved by james romm in babylon on june   bc at about  alexander the great died aged  having conquered an empire stretching from modern albania to eastern pakistan the question of what or who killed the macedonian king has never been answered successfully today new theories are heating up one of historys longestrunning cold cases like the death of stalin to which it is sometimes compared the death of alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the kings body was cold but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects fuel was added to the fire by oliver stones alexander released in  with new versions in  and  a film that whatever its artistic flaws presents a historically informed theory about who killed alexander and why few events have been as unexpected as the death of alexander the king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his  campaign through asia enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles some had come to think of him as divine an idea fostered and perhaps entertained by alexander himself in  fighting almost singlehanded against south asian warriors alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches a  trek along the barren coast of southern iran consequently when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later the shock felt by his  army was intense so was the confusion about who would next lead it for alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir though one would be born shortly after his death the sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point the start of a halfcentury of instability and strife known today as the wars of the successors events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes it is disturbing to think that blind chance \\u2013 a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito \\u2013 put the ancient world on a perilous new course an explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring even though it involves a darker view of alexanders relations with his companions the inner circle of friends and highranking officers that surrounded him in babylon ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of alexanders death though many attribute it to disease in  eugene borza a scholar specialising in ancient macedon took part in a medical board of inquiry at the university of maryland which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever borza has since defended that finding in print malaria smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed with alcoholism infection from the lung wound and grief \\u2013 alexanders close friend hephaestion had died some months earlier \\u2013 often seen as complicating factors but some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness or even to choose between illness or murder two alexander experts who once made this choice one on each side later changed their opinions to undecided with historical research at an impasse alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology they are reopening the alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation the idea that alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in  thanks to the ending of stones film in its epilogue alexanders senior general ptolemy played by anthony hopkins looking back over decades at his commanders death declares the truth is we did kill him by silence we consented  because we couldnt go on ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again you shall write he died of disease and in weakened condition the idea that alexanders generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of stones famously plotprone imagination there is some evidence that not even alexanders senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere in india in  bc at the eastern edge of the indus river system alexanders army staged a sitdown strike when ordered to march eastward towards the ganges even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy since alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death i cant believe that these men were going on with alexander to arabia and carthage he said in a  interview at the university of california berkeley stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that ptolemy masterminded a coverup of alexanders murder but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed the account ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the royal journals though now lost it was summarised in different versions by arrian and plutarch two greek writers of the roman empire who endorsed it as the most reliable record of alexanders last days some scholars led by the australian classicist brian bosworth believe the royal journals were falsified to make alexanders death appear natural just as stones film represents though in bosworths view the culprit was eumenes alexanders court secretary rather than ptolemy others disagree taking the journals to be just what arrian and plutarch thought they were an undoctored daybyday eyewitness account       the debate over the royal journals has huge implications for our understanding of alexanders death because arrian and plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources both authors say that alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named medius his fever grew worse over the course of  or  days the two accounts differ in chronology leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak as his troops shuffled past his sickbed arrian reports alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one death followed the next day but a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that stone followed in alexander in this alternate version alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and more importantly just as he drained a huge cup of wine these accounts say that alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud from that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms including great pain convulsions and delirium but they say little or nothing about fever the keynote of the plutarch and arrian accounts a stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison which is why plutarch in his biography of alexander vehemently denied that it had occurred some writers think they have to say such things as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama he sneered apparently the dispute between those who thought alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder \\u2013 essentially those who did or did not trust the royal journals \\u2013 was already rife in plutarchs day probably all reports of alexanders symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely for supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is of course whodunnit stones film is remarkably cagey about answering this question in the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the companions to show that they know alexanders cup contains poison but no clue is given as to how it got there by contrast many greek and roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it but how and with what poison with remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at antipater the senior general whom alexander had left in charge of the macedonian homeland and at two of his sons cassander and iollas antipater may indeed have had reason to want alexander dead in the spring of  bc for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to babylon perhaps with hostile intent antipater stayed put but sent cassander in his stead according to several ancient accounts antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water collected from the legendary river styx believed to flow above ground in the northern peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld the water had to be transported in a hollowedout mules hoof for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn in babylon ran the story cassander passed this mules hoof to his brother iollas \\u2013 conveniently enough alexanders winepourer \\u2013 who then slipped the toxin into the kings drink the basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling but details vary some versions mention the philosopher aristotle as a coconspirator he was a known friend of antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student alexander who had sanctioned the death of his relative callisthenes others make medius the host of the final fatal dinner party and allegedly iollas male lover a participant in the plot one very early version published in an anonymous greek pamphlet now known as the last days and testament of alexander made iollas doubly guilty when the first draught of poison failed to kill alexander iollas administered a second soaking in styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit until recently historians dismissed the story of the styx waterpoisoning as a fiction possibly a political smear designed to harm antipater and cassander both were contestants for power in the era after alexanders death and had many enemies especially olympias alexanders vengeful mother who perhaps to help foster the idea of antipaters familys guilt eventually had iollas grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind even the idea that ordinary greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd in  the distinguished classicist jg frazer declared that the waters the greeks identified as the styx today called blackwater or mavroneri contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century but in a presentation at a conference in barcelona in  the historian adrienne mayor and the toxicologist antoinette hayes proposed that the limestone around mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today though they may have disappeared over the centuries mayor and hayes argue that calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for alexander \\u2013 including his high fever usually seen as proof of a natural death the research of mayor and hayes might suggest that alexander was murdered though the authors themselves stop short of that claim they are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself their thesis that the styx really was strongly toxic would account for why antipater and his sons were the ancient worlds prime suspects cassanders journey from europe to babylon just a few weeks before the onset of alexanders symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which styx water could have arrived at the kings banquet table cassander later helped confirm the ancient worlds suspicions about him by usurping the throne of macedonia and executing alexanders mother wife and son the authors are also interested in how in the greek imagination the mythic resonance of the styx a river thought able to stupefy even the gods made it an ideal weapon for antipater and his sons to use such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to alexander mayor said recently an ordinary common drug would not do only a very rare potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for alexander it remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of antipaters conspiracy can help crack the mystery but it is clear that the mayorhayes approach matching toxins available to the ancient world with alexanders reported symptoms has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery three other investigators have pursued it in recent years combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin ptolemy one of alexanders leading generals committed the murder with arsenic rhoxane the kings wife did it with strychnine alexanders physicians did it but by accident with powdered hellebore root the last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the new zealand toxicologist leo schep and the scotland yard detective john grieve these two men were brought together in a  television documentary alexander the greats mysterious death schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore used medicinally by the ancient greeks but lethal in large doses could best account for alexanders recorded symptoms grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin as schep had supposed but by alexanders doctors who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him grieves ingenious speculation is only that but has already won the endorsement of at least one alexander specialist the british classicist richard stoneman hellebore despite its dangers was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects stoneman notes but it was easy to get the dose wrong and alexanders doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in babylon \\u2013 or even misread the babylonian label but the toxicology on which schep and grieve rely is evidently not an exact science especially when practiced at a distance of  years the author graham phillips submitted the same record of alexanders symptoms as scheps to the los angeles county regional poison center but obtained a very different answer in his  book alexander the great murder in babylon phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like alexanders following a twisting at times tortuous trail of logic phillips tries to identify alexanders murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine the poisonous plant is rare along alexanders route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent modern pakistan not all of alexanders retinue followed him into such areas allowing phillips to eliminate potential suspects he concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill alexander also had the means rhoxane the first of the kings three wives she had become enraged at alexander phillips assumes by his two subsequent marriages to persian princesses and killed him this view of rhoxane as a latterday medea revives one popularised in the  english tragedy by nataniel lee the rival queens but is not supported by evidence oliver stone too portrays rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman though he makes her guilty of the death of hephaestion \\u2013 in his view alexanders male lover \\u2013 rather than alexander himself arsenic gets the spotlight in a  book the death of alexander the great by paul doherty novelist and amateur historian doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by plutarch and the roman writer quintus curtius alexanders body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of babylon for a week or more doherty cites toxicology studies of the  century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification however the jury seems to be out on this point and for obvious reasons opportunities for field tests are few if alexanders body really did resist decomposition \\u2013 and some experts consider the story a fiction \\u2013 then numerous explanations have to be considered those who believe alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol strychnine hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the nondecay phenomenon alexander in their view only appeared to die on june  he actually entered a deep coma he may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him dohertys book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at ptolemy as its lead suspect ptolemy got the best postalexander assignment of any of the leading generals a posting in wealthy egypt he eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries until finally lost by his descendant cleopatra in  bc doherty argues backward from ptolemys later success reasoning that he who gained the most from alexanders death had the greatest incentive to bring it about it is the same thinking that oliver stone used when he made ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in alexander as the director said in the berkeley interview i go back to  jfk cui bono who benefits it is startling to think that ptolemy or rhoxane two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to alexander may have wanted him dead but those possibilities cannot be ruled out neither can stones hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in alexanders murder at least by not intervening to prevent it by silence we consented indeed john atkinson a south african classicist has put forward a scenario very much like that of stones film in a  journal article entitled alexanders last days malaria and mind games coauthored with two medical specialists elsie and etienne truter like stone atkinson portrays an alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates the officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap he and his coauthors write men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger in atkinsons view the campaigns alexander had in mind in june  bc \\u2013 including conquest of arabia carthage and the entire mediterranean coast \\u2013 were a bridge too far for alexanders officers having turned him back from the east by mutiny he argues these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the west even while regarding alexander as a pariah to his own people atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms his verdict is something closer to euthanasia after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the mind games of the articles title the officers in alexanders court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive atkinson writes maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die and so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios mayor and hayes raise the possibility that alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered john grieve suspects he was poisoned but by accident atkinson makes the case that alexanders death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural but something in between if the embalmed body of alexander is ever found \\u2013 and some researchers continue to hunt for it \\u2013 we may finally learn what caused his death but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century ad it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at alexandria meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by plutarch arrian diodorus justin and quintus curtius unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots with physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories opponents of such theories have long noted that alexander himself during the  or  days he slid towards death never gave any sign that he suspected poison though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years he would never have gone willingly to his death as oliver stones film appears to imply nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him a slow decline would allow him to order their executions to assert that alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled the same point could be made about what followed alexanders death the chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination if the goal of the generals was to go home and spend their dough as oliver stone asserted in his berkeley interview they failed miserably none ever returned to macedonia and only ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security many of the others continued fighting and killing each other given how central alexander was to the stability of their world they had no reason in june  bc to expect otherwise any plan to poison alexander would have been fraught with perils especially for macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins conspiracy theories have to assume that alexanders generals hated their commander enough to risk everything it is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king thus it is easier in the end to believe that alexander died of disease despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise about the authorjames romm is james h ottaway jr professor of

On 4 November 1979, the embassy was stormed by Iranian protestors, forcing Lijek, his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by Canada and the CIA. At 9am on Sunday 4 November 1979, Mark Lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of Iranian protestors climbed the gate of the US Embassy in Tehran. The attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between Iran and the US, culminating in what would be one of the modern era\\u2019s highest-profile hostage crises. As the embassy fell into Iranian hands, however, Lijek and five others, including his wife, would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country. Their incredible story was retold in the Oscar-winning 2012 film Argo, but here Lijek tells us what really happened. Lijek served as a consular officer for the US Embassy in Tehran, while his wife Cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office. \\u201cMost of the Americans worked in two buildings; the vast majority were in the Chancellery, which was in the south centre of the compound, and the rest of us worked in the consular annex, which was about a five-minute walk to the northwest,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201cOur compound was very large, 26 acres [10 hectares] and about a mile [1.6 kilometres] of wall, and we had 13 marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing, so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question. The plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue.\\u201d It quickly became apparent, though, that rescue was out of the question. \\u201cWe had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons, locked everything down, and we basically just sat there,\\u201d continues Lijek. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour. Finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building. \\u201cEventually, somebody noticed our building was not fully protected. It was brand new, we had all these latest security upgrades, but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows. They were just normal glass, no bars, no nothing. So somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in, and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder. He pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below. A friend and I grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together, but if they really wanted to break through they could have, and I\\u2019m not sure why we were left alone from that point on, but we sort of were.\\u201d It became a very nervous wait for Lijek and his colleagues. The electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait, which they did for two hours. \\u201cFinally we were told that we should try to get to the British compound,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cThere was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go, but given the circumstances we didn\\u2019t have much choice.\\u201d The marine opened the door and one of Lijek\\u2019s friends crept out, finding three policemen who didn\\u2019t have any objections to them leaving. The Iranian customers and\\u00a0employees in the building had already made a break to get home, leaving just 13 Americans behind. It was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success; the two married couples, Lijek and his wife being one, left in the first group of six with two civilian Americans who were there on business. \\u201cI assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first, and in fact that\\u2019s how it turned out,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201dWe made it. That second group that left a few minutes after us did not, with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me, this fella Bob Anders, our immigration chief.\\u201d In addition to the embassy swarming with protestors, the streets were alive with revolutionaries. \\u201dI was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us,\\u201d says Lijek, \\u201cand in fact that\\u2019s exactly what happened to that second group of Americans. They followed us but we came to the first major north-south street, and we turned south, which was the proper direction to go to the British compound. The second group, which included our boss, the consular general, decided to go to his house and play bridge instead, so they turned north. And apparently that little change in plan got them caught, because they got about 150 yards [135 metres] north and some guy with a G3 [rifle] came running after them, rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy.\\u201d Lijek and his group made their way to the British compound through the narrow city streets, but when they got to Ferdowsi Square, which was right in front of the compound, they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path. Ducking into an alley, they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to Anders\\u2019 apartment and wait out the trouble. \\u201cYou have to remember, we\\u2019re still thinking all we\\u2019ve got to do is hide out for a few hours, we did not know that there would be no rescue,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cSo once we got to Bob\\u2019s place we were feeling pretty good. We sat around, had a nice lunch, had a few drinks, listened to the BBC describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and we\\u2019d be back at work tomorrow.\\u201d By 11pm, four of them, Lijek and his wife and the other couple, Joe and Kathy Stafford, made their way to the Iran-America Society to spend the night. The following day they were on the move again, this time finally to the British compound after a brief stop at the Staffords\\u2019 apartment, but all the while an uncooperative Washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were. That Monday, 5 November, the British Embassy (separate from the British compound they were in) was attacked. \\u201cThe compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in,\\u201d says Lijek \\u201cFrankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it. So London and Washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you.\\u201d Lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again. \\u201cAs it was, we did feel like we\\u2019d been abandoned,\\u201d he reveals. Virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee, known as a komiteh, and Lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught. The group were moved to a US Embassy house under the care of a Thai cook called Sam, but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper, an elderly Thai lady, was not comfortable with them being there. After a row between Sam and her on 10 November, she left the house in a foul mood, and the Americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence. Fortunately, Anders had been in contact with his Canadian counterpart, John Sheardown, who insisted they join him at his residence at the Canadian Embassy, which hadn\\u2019t been touched by the Iranians. At the Sheardown residence they were able to relax, to an extent. As Americans who had been in the US Embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the Iranians would almost certainly hold them captive, along with the 52 other American hostages. The Canadians were extremely welcoming, however, and Prime Minister Joe Clark sanctioned their stay, unbeknown to the Iranians, of course. They would end up remaining there for two months and, while not uncomfortable, it was not without peril. \\u201cIn terms of specific threats, one really was John\\u2019s gardener,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201cHe was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us, and that was kind of a problem because John\\u2019s house had a lot of glass walls, and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted. There were other little things, like the garbage; John had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house you\\u2019ve got seven [an additional member of the group was added, who had been hiding with the Swedes, while the Staffords were in a residence nearby]. The garbage man was also a member of the komiteh, so John had to start carrying the garbage to work. The other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord, so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days. But we didn\\u2019t like going outside, we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons. On one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of Iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road. That was really nice of them but, I mean, it was outside of my comfort zone! It\\u2019s not that I expected everybody to know my face or whatever, it\\u2019s not like they were putting up wanted posters, but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful.\\u201d By January, Lijek\\u2019s group was getting restless, so they asked the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor to relay a message to Washington asking for help to leave Iran. But it would not be until late January that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out. The CIA had put together a fake science-fiction movie called Argo, complete with posters, a script and press releases, and the plan was to pretend the group were Hollywood employees out in Tehran shooting a movie. \\u201dWe didn\\u2019t really know anything about the CIA or the specifics of the plan until 26 January when [CIA agent] Tony Mendez and his partner, Julio, came to the house in the evening,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201dWe were briefed on three possible options [for escape]: one of course was the Hollywood scenario, but it was pretty obvious from the way Tony presented them that the other two were throwaways. One, I think, had us as agronomists or something like that, and the other I think we were people involved in a petroleum venture. The Hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility, frankly, because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done? Hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality, it seems, and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime.\\u201d Lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan. They were each given roles to play; Lijek was the transportation coordinator for the \\u2018movie\\u2019, his wife the scriptwriter, and so on. They were given new identities, new passports and told to alter their appearance. However, one member of their group, Joe Stafford, did not like the plan at all. \\u201cHe thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released, which to me made no sense,\\u201d says Lijek. Stafford\\u2019s refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission. Thankfully, in the morning of 27 January, the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly. Unlike the 2012 movie, their journey to and through the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran was largely uneventful, apart from a brief delay for their plane. There was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed. Indeed, the plan went so well that Lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the Iranians: \\u201cWhat Tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us,\\u201d explains Lijek \\u201cA professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour, so the thing Tony didn\\u2019t want was for us to be nervous, so he needed us to believe in the scenario. We made a game of it, and with the exception of Joe we were having fun.\\u201d Aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour, the group ultimately boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich on the morning of Sunday 27 January 1980, finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close. \\u201cOnce we got out of Iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cWe toasted each other and it was an amazing moment. It\\u2019s kind of hard to describe, there were just so many different emotions, including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind, but for ourselves it was like magic. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress, finally it just all of a sudden goes away. It was incredible.\\u201d Although they managed to escape relatively trouble free, not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily, and one man who remained uncertain was President Carter, who later said the Argo six\\u2019 had just a fifty-fifty chance of successfully leaving Iran. \\u201cI\\u2019m surprised he would have launched the operation with only a 50 per cent chance of success,\\u201d admits Lijek. \\u201dI did ask Tony about that and he denied it, he said he figured we were at least 75-25 in favour, and that\\u2019s kind of what I would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in Tehran. \\u201cIf Tony had told us we had a fifty-fifty chance, I don\\u2019t think we would have voted [to go]. One thing I did learn from the [2012 film Argo] was the risk we were running. It didn\\u2019t occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a CIA escort, you know we are spies at that point, and so who knows what they would do. That never really occurred to me until the movie came out.\\u201d Thankfully, the escape went according to plan, but while Lijek and his group were free in the USA by early 1980, the ordeal was far from over for the 52 other Americans who were still being held hostage in Iran. They would not be freed until a year later, on 20 January 1981, after Iraq invaded and forced Iran to enter negotiations with the US. Had the \\u2018Argo six\\u2019 left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed, on 4 November 1979, it\\u2019s almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity. However, they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country, thanks in no small part to the help from Canada, a gesture widely heralded across the United States. Such was Canada\\u2019s role alongside the CIA that the rescue of the \\u2018Argo six\\u2019 is now known as the Canadian Caper, and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten. \\u00a0 * * * In the year leading up to the uprising, tensions between Iran and the United States had escalated when Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (or ruler) of Iran, was admitted to the US for cancer treatment. In February 1979, he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, leaving a provisional government in place. This government failed to quell the revolution and ultimately, on 4 November 1979, another uprising saw a group of Iranian students take over the US Embassy in Tehran. Although Lijek\\u2019s group escaped within a few months, 52 other Americans were held hostage until 20 January 1981, when they were released as a result of Iraq invading Iran in September 1980.

He lent his name to ambition and did so in a minimal amount of time. In the handful of years between Austerlitz and Waterloo, he took the world. When defeated, he had marked it forever. Then, from the exile of Saint Helena, he soared into legend. It all began on another island, Corsica, where the future general was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio to a family of ancient and noble Tuscan origins: his father Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, a lawyer, and his mother Maria Letizia Ramolino, a descendant of a wealthy Italian family. At ten, a scholarship opened the doors to the exclusive military school of Brienne-le-Ch\\u00e2teau in northern France, where the offspring of high lineage learned the art of war. It was five years of study and reading, and also of taunts: his classmates didn\\u2019t forgive his Corsican origin and his halting French. Napoleon emerged with a quarrelsome and solitary disposition and a strong spirit of revenge, pride bolstered by a bitter anti-French resentment. His military career progressed rapidly: in 1784, he moved to the Royal School of Paris, and at just sixteen years old, he was assigned to an artillery regiment stationed at La F\\u00e8re in Picardy. When the revolution broke out in 1789, Napoleon joined and obtained a leave to return to Corsica, hoping the new upheavals could benefit the island\\u2019s cause. However, he had to flee in 1793 with his family after breaking with the independence front. In Paris, the revolution had already led to the Reign of Terror, and the guillotine was in full swing. Appointed captain, he was sent by the Committee of Public Health to suppress dissent in Marseille, later taking command of the troops in Toulon, where monarchists, supported by the English, had entrenched themselves. The young officer brilliantly resolved the city\\u2019s siege, exhibiting artillery force management that already revealed the genius strategist. A success that earned him the rank of brigade general and the attention of future Directory member Paul Barras, who two years later, on October 5, 1795, appointed him commander of the Paris garrison: Napoleon saved the National Convention by quelling the royalist uprising in blood. He was named general of the Army Corps of the Interior: at only 26 years old, he was a rapidly rising star. Marriage to Josephine and the Italian Triumphs In the Capital, the young Corsican met the high society: he went to the theater, organized dinners, and stepped into the influential salons. He was captivated by the charm of Josephine Tasher, widow Beauharnais, a great lady with a thousand connections, older than him, in debt, but still the owner of a rich income. She bet on the magnetic-eyed soldier; he on a refined woman capable of polishing his manners. On March 9, 1796, he married her and, on the 27th of the same month, was already in Nice commanding the Army of Italy, ready to battle Austria, the leader of the coalition among the major European monarchies terrified by the specter of the \\u201crevolutionary plague.\\u201d The campaign began on April 12; on May 14, Napoleon entered Milan as a conqueror. In just over a month, the young military man, having delivered to legend, took everyone by surprise by attacking from Liguria, dividing the enemy front, and routing first the Piedmontese and then the Austrians of the old general Beaulieu, literally at the mercy of the rival\\u2019s strategic choices. Leading an exhausted, poorly paid, scarcely equipped, outnumbered army, Napoleon accomplished his first masterpiece, built on the innovative management of troops, meticulous preparation of battles, selection of officers as courageous and bold as him, and the ability to revitalize the army by instilling a common sentiment that becomes a shared dream of glory when the bond between troop and leader solidifies into fanatic devotion to the commander. In Italy, Napoleon discovered he had greatness equal to his ambition. And he began to serve both. On August 5 at Castiglione delle Stiviere, he won his first major field battle, pushing to Venice and forcing Austria to the Treaty of Campoformio. Crowned with the laurel of the victor, he became politically cumbersome in France. The Directory preferred to distance him from Paris by entrusting him with the occupation of Egypt, aimed at countering British economic interests in the seas. The campaign was a failure: despite the victorious Battle of the Pyramids fought on July 21, 1798, the commander had to witness the complete destruction of the fleet by the hands of English Admiral Horatio Nelson and surrender to the impossibility of taking the ancient Crusader fortress of Saint John of Acre. Returning home, he found the Directory in crisis and the army in tatters. There was no choice but a coup. On November 9, 1799 (according to the revolutionary calendar, 18 Brumaire), Bonaparte dissolved the Chambers, power passed to three consuls who introduced a new constitution, then ratified by a plebiscite. Appointed First Consul, the general had the country in his hands and shaped it on a model of strong administrative centralization: the country was divided into departments with the new figure of the prefect at the helm. He also resolved the long-standing dispute with the Church, signing the concordat that established the state\\u2019s secularity. He founded the National Bank and reorganized the educational system, including the lyc\\u00e9e, the forge of the new ruling class. But if France was his, Italy was slipping away. The second anti-French coalition had overturned some of the republics born from the first expedition, so the First Consul returned to war and victory, first at Montebello and then at Marengo, on June 14, 1800. From the triumph was born, in 1802, the Italian Republic, of which Bonaparte became president, while the Treaty of Amiens signed with the United Kingdom granted two years of respite to Europe. At Notre-Dame, in 1804, Napoleon received from Pope Pius VII the crown of French emperor; the following year in Milan, in the Duomo, he placed the Iron Crown of King of Italy on his head. French Emperor and King of Italy At the height of glory and power, he targeted England. But the planned invasion of the island clashed with the disproportion of naval forces and foundered after the annihilation of the fleet at Trafalgar by Nelson. In 1805, Napoleon faced the third anti-French coalition, which this time involved England, Austria, and Russia, sending his most valiant marshal, Andrea Massena, to \\u201cdisturb\\u201d the Austrians in Italy, while he personally took command of the \\u201cGrande Arm\\u00e9e.\\u201d It was the eve of Austerlitz, Bonaparte\\u2019s strategic masterpiece: on December 3, 1805, on the anniversary of his coronation, he defeated the Austro-Russians. The following year he also defeated Frederick William II\\u2019s Prussia at Jena and made his triumphant entrance into Berlin. In 1807 at Friedland, the army of Tsar Alexander capitulated. Practically unbeatable, leading an army drunk with success, the emperor now imposed the Continental Blockade, forbidding ships flying the English flag from docking at any port, thus hoping to bend the British economy. To the pope who refused to adhere, he responded with the capture of Rome and the annexation of the Papal States to the empire, and when the excommunication bull arrived, he had the pontiff arrested, who was then transferred to France, first to Grenoble and then to Fontainebleau. The blockade, however, was a failure. Too many states circumvented it, including Portugal, which was invaded in retaliation. Napoleon then took advantage of the dynastic dispute between Charles IV and his son to force both to abdicate and place his brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, without, however, managing to tame the guerrillas or even to annihilate the English expeditionary force that in the meantime had liberated the Lusitanian state. Despite the difficulties, in 1809 he also bent the fifth coalition (yet another alliance between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom), defeated from a position of undisputed military superiority. He occupied Vienna and the Sch\\u00f6nbrunn Castle and dictated a harsh peace to the Austrians. Meanwhile, he agreed with their prime minister Metternich on a state marriage capable of definitively reconciling France and Austria and, hopefully, of granting the emperor the longed-for male heir. He had divorced Josephine, his beloved but unfaithful companion, and now married Maria Luisa of Austria, niece of Marie Antoinette. But the son born in 1811, Napoleon Francis, known as the King of Rome, would never ascend the throne and would die at just 21 years old. Determined to strike a final blow against Tsar Alexander, the Emperor attempted the invasion of Russia, a titanic endeavor that ended in an epochal defeat. The numbers don\\u2019t lie: the Emperor set off at the head of an army of 700,000 men, of which over 400,000 would never return. The defeat gave rise to the European powers. Napoleon, back in France, worked night and day to rebuild the army, about 400,000 strong, largely young recruits. The wounded old lion was enough to keep the Prussians at bay, but not the bulk of the coalition, including the Austrians, who did not seem to greatly respect the previous year\\u2019s marriage. The French army capitulated at Leipzig. Napoleon entrusted the regency to his wife and the capital to his brother, then took the lead of 60,000 veterans and for two months kept the enemy forces at bay, eventually yielding to the Prussians. On March 31, 1813, Tsar Alexander entered Paris. Napoleon was forced to abdicate. After an attempted suicide with arsenic, miraculously thwarted, and a moving farewell to the Old Guard, he reached Marseille and sailed for his exile on Elba. On the island, he vented his hyperactivity by building roads and infrastructure and kept a watchful eye on Paris where Louis XVIII, back on the throne after his abdication, had already alienated the favor of the people. Fleeing from Elba to the legendary \\u2018Hundred Days\\u2019 Ten months of confinement were enough. He escaped British surveillance and on March 1, 1815, landed at Antibes: the legendary \\u2018Hundred Days\\u2019 began. Marching towards Paris, he raised unexpected popular enthusiasm: his mere appearance was enough to persuade the troops sent against him by the king to mutiny. Back on the throne, he reorganized the army and promulgated a more liberal constitution. The final duel awaited him. He faced his usual enemies, with the United Kingdom and Prussia at the forefront. He still planned to divide the predominant opposing forces, but the maneuver only partially succeeded. Waterloo would be the last chapter of the inimitable military history of the fabulous Corsican. Tactical and organizational errors would decree the historic defeat of June 18, 1815, also weighed down by the choice of generals not up to the task. Having found refuge in the Ch\\u00e2teau de Malmaison, Napoleon awaited his fate: on July 15, he surrendered to the British. Convinced he could live as a private citizen in England or the United States, he instead faced life imprisonment on the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. On that speck of land, closely watched by a British contingent, the man who had been master of Europe died on May 5, 1821, at 17:49, struck down by stomach cancer. Buried on the island, his body was only returned to Paris for a solemn funeral in 1840. Since 1861, he rests in a monumental tomb in the Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides. THE GREATEST LEGACY: THE NAPOLEONIC CODE\\nDuring his exile on the Island of Saint Helena, following the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon often emphasized that his most important work, the one that would go down in history more than his military victories, would be the Napoleonic Code. He was right. Promulgated in 36 laws on March 21, 1804 \\u2013 followed by the Code of Civil Procedure in 1806 and the Commercial Code in 1807 \\u2013 it was the first modern civil code, of which Napoleon was not only the inspirer and promoter but also shared in its drafting, entrusted to four great jurists. It is thanks to Napoleon, who lacked legal knowledge, that the Code is noted for its particular clarity. Still in force in France and Belgium, and a model for the Italian and Spanish codes, the Napoleonic Code confirmed the major achievements of the French Revolution, while distancing itself from the excesses of the legislation from 1789-1804: legal equality before the law, religious freedom, the right to private property, and the secularism of the state, putting an end to the legacies of the Ancien R\\u00e9gime, feudalism, absolutism, creating a predominantly bourgeois society. NAPOLEON ACCORDING TO RIDLEY SCOTT\\u2019S FILM\\nThe unfulfilled dream of Stanley Kubrick was realized by Ridley Scott, who, over twenty years after Gladiator, finds his \\u201cemperor\\u201d Joaquin Phoenix again, this time in the role of Napoleon, in the biopic produced by Apple Original and distributed by Sony Pictures, one of the most anticipated films of fall 2023. Vanessa Kirby, skyrocketed to fame after her role in The Crown, portrays the first wife of the French emperor, Josephine Bonaparte. The cast also includes Tahar Rahim, Scott Caine, Ben Miles, and Paul Rhys. The film retraces Bonaparte\\u2019s unstoppable rise to power through his tumultuous relationship with his only true love, Josephine, showcasing the visionary political and military strategies of the great leader, in some of the most realistic and spectacular battle scenes ever made. The screenplay is written by David Scarpa, who had previously collaborated with Scott on All the Money in the World. Conoscere la Storia, December/January 2024 * * * ORIGINAL ITALIAN ARTICLE: L\\u2019irresistibile ascesa e la repentina caduta dell\\u2019uomo che sconvolse l\\u2019Europa in meno di vent\\u2019anni di Mario Galloni Da ufficiale d\\u2019artiglieria a generale, poi re e infine imperatore. Napoleone Bonaparte \\u00e8 stato tutto: genio militare, politico, giurista, talento creativo sostenuto da un dinamismo senza pari. Ha dato il suo nome all\\u2019ambizione e lo ha fatto in un tempo minimo. In quel pugno di anni che separano Austerlitz da Waterloo si \\u00e8 preso il mondo. Quando, sconf\\u00ectto, lo ha restituito, la sua impronta l\\u2019aveva segnato per sempre. Poi dall\\u2019esilio di Sant\\u2019Elena ha spiccato il volo nella leggenda. Tutto era cominciato su un\\u2019altra isola, la Corsica, dove il futuro generale nasce il 15 agosto 1769 ad Ajaccio da una famiglia di antiche e nobili origini toscane: il padre Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, avvocato, la madre Maria Letizia Ramolino, discendente di un\\u2019agiata casata italiana. A dieci anni una borsa di studio gli spalanca le porte dell\\u2019esclusiva scuola militare di Brienne-le-Ch\\u00e2teau, nord della Francia, dove imparano l\\u2019arte della guerra i pargoli di alto lignaggio. Sar\\u00e0 un lustro di studio e letture, e anche di sberleffi: i compagni non gli perdonano l\\u2019origine corsa e quel francese zoppicante. Napoleone ne uscir\\u00e0 con una disposizione d\\u2019animo scontrosa e solitaria e un forte spirito di rivalsa, l\\u2019orgoglio rafforzato da un acre risentimento antifrancese. La carriera militare procede spedita: nel 1784 passa alla Regia scuola di Parigi e a soli sedici anni viene assegnato ad un reggimento di artiglieria di stanza a La F\\u00e8re, in Piccardia. Quando scoppia la rivoluzione, nel 1789, Napoleone aderisce e ottiene una licenza per tornare in Corsica, sperando che i nuovi fermenti possano giovare alla causa dell\\u2019isola. Dovr\\u00e0 invece fuggire nel 1793 con tutta la famiglia dopo aver rotto con il fronte indipendentista. A Parigi la rivoluzione \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 sfociata nel Terrore, la ghigliottina lavora a pieno regime. Nominato capitano, viene inviato dal Comitato di Salute Pubblica a reprimere il dissenso a Marsiglia, in seguito prender\\u00e0 il comando delle truppe a Tolone, dove i monarchici, sostenuti dagli inglesi, si sono trincerati. Il giovane ufficiale risolve brillantemente l\\u2019assedio della citt\\u00e0, esibendo una gestione delle forze d\\u2019artiglieria che gi\\u00e0 rivela il geniale stratega. Un successo che gli vale la nomina a generale di brigata e l\\u2019attenzione del futuro membro del Direttorio Paul Barras, che due anni dopo, il 5 ottobre 1795, lo nomina comandante della piazza di Parigi: Napoleone salva la Convenzione nazionale soffocando nel sangue la rivolta monarchica. Arriva la nomina a generale del Corpo d\\u2019armata dell\\u2019Interno: a soli 26 anni \\u00e8 una stella in rapida ascesa. Il matrimonio con Giuseppina e i trionfi italiani Nella Capitale il giovane corso incontra il gran mondo: va a teatro, organizza cene e mette piede nei salotti che contano. Rimane stregato dal fascino di Giuseppina Tasher, vedova Beauharnais, gran signora dalle mille relazioni, pi\\u00f9 grande di lui, indebitata, ma pur sempre titolare di una ricca rendita: lei scommette su quel militare dallo sguardo magnetico, lui su una donna raffinata in grado di ripulirne modi e maniere. Il 9 marzo 1796 la sposa e il 27 dello stesso mese \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 a Nizza al comando dell\\u2019Armata d\\u2019Italia pronta a dar battaglia all\\u2019Austria, capofila della coalizione tra le maggiori monarchie europee terrorizzate dallo spettro della \\u201cpeste rivoluzionaria\\u201d. La campagna comincia il 12 aprile; il 14 maggio Napoleone entra da trionfatore a Milano. In poco pi\\u00f9 di un mese, consegnato alla leggenda, il giovane militare ha spiazzato tutti attaccando dalla Liguria, diviso il fronte nemico e sbaragliato prima i piemontesi e poi gli austriaci del vecchio generale Beaulieu, letteralmente in balia delle scelte strategiche del rivale. A capo di un esercito infiacchito, mal pagato, scarsamente equipaggiato, inferiore di numero, Napoleone ha compiuto il suo primo capolavoro, costruito sulla gestione innovativa delle truppe, la meticolosa preparazione degli scontri, la scelta di ufficiali coraggiosi e spavaldi quanto lui, la capacit\\u00e0 di rivitalizzare l\\u2019esercito consegnando agli uomini un comune sentire che diventa sogno di gloria condiviso quando il rapporto tra truppa e condottiero si salda al punto da diventare devozione fanatica al condottiero. Napoleone in Italia scopre dunque di avere una grandezza pari alla sua ambizione. E comincia a servire entrambe. Il 5 agosto a Castiglione delle Stiviere vince la sua prima grande battaglia campale spingendosi fino a Venezia e costringendo l\\u2019Austria al trattato di Campoformio. Cinto dall\\u2019alloro del trionfatore, in Francia diventa politicamente ingombrante. Il Direttorio preferisce allontanarlo da Parigi affidandogli l\\u2019occupazione dell\\u2019Egitto, volta a contrastare gli interessi economici inglesi sui mari. La campagna sar\\u00e0 un fallimento: nonostante la vittoriosa battaglia delle Piramidi combattuta il 21 luglio 1798, il condottiero dovr\\u00e0 assistere alla completa distruzione della flotta per mano dell\\u2019ammiraglio inglese Horatio Nelson e arrendersi all\\u2019impossibilit\\u00e0 di prendere l\\u2019antica fortezza crociata di San Giovanni d\\u2019Acri. Fatto ritorno in patria, trova il Direttorio in crisi e l\\u2019esercito a pezzi. Non resta che il colpo di stato. Il 9 novembre 1799 (secondo il calendario rivoluzionario, 18 brumaio) Bonaparte fa sciogliere le Camere, il potere passa a tre consoli che varano una nuova costituzione, poi ratificata da un plebiscito. Fattosi nominare Primo Console, il generale ha in mano il Paese e lo modella sul modello di un forte accentramento amministrativo: il Paese viene diviso in dipartimenti con a capo la nuova figura del prefetto. Chiude anche l\\u2019annoso contenzioso con la Chiesa, siglando il concordato che sancisce la laicit\\u00e0 dello Stato. Fonda la Banca nazionale e riorganizza il sistema scolastico dove trova spazio il liceo, fucina della nuova classe dirigente. Ma se la Francia \\u00e8 sua, l\\u2019Italia gli sta sfuggendo. La seconda coalizione antifrancese ha rovesciato parte delle repubbliche figlie della prima spedizione, cos\\u00ec il Primo Console torna alla guerra e alla vittoria, prima a Montebello e poi a Marengo, il 14 giugno 1800. Dal trionfo nasce, nel 1802, la Repubblica italiana di cui Bonaparte diviene presidente, mentre il trattato di Amiens stipulato con il Regno Unito regala due anni di tregua all\\u2019Europa. A Notre-Dame, nel 1804, Napoleone riceve da papa Pio VII la corona di imperatore francese; l\\u2019anno dopo a Milano, in Duomo, cinge quella Ferrea di re d\\u2019Italia. Imperatore francese e re d\\u2019Italia All\\u2019apice della gloria e del potere, mette nel mirino l\\u2019Inghilterra. Ma la progettata invasione dell\\u2019isola si scontra con la sproporzione delle forze navali e naufraga dopo l\\u2019annientamento, a Trafalgar, della flotta a opera ancora di Nelson. Nel 1805 Napoleone fronteggia quindi la terza coalizione antifrancese che stavolta vede impegnate Inghilterra, Austria e Russia, spedendo il suo pi\\u00f9 valente maresciallo, Andrea Massena, a \\u201cdisturbare\\u201d gli austriaci in Italia, mentre in persona assume il comando della \\u201cGrande Armata\\u201d. \\u00c8 la vigilia di Austerlitz, capolavoro strategico di Bonaparte: il 3 dicembre 1805, nell\\u2019anniversario della sua incoronazione, sbaraglia gli austro-russi. L\\u2019anno seguente sconf\\u00ecgge anche la Prussia di Federico Guglielmo II a Jena e fa il suo trionfale ingresso a Berlino. Nel 1807 a Friedland capitola l\\u2019esercito dello zar Alessandro. Praticamente imbattibile, alla testa di un\\u2019armata ebbra di successi, l\\u2019imperatore impone ora il blocco continentale, vietando alle navi battenti bandiera inglese l\\u2019attracco in qualsiasi porto, auspicando cos\\u00ec di piegare l\\u2019economia britannica. Al papa che rifiuta di aderirvi risponde con la presa di Roma e l\\u2019annessione dello Stato pontificio all\\u2019impero e quando arriva la bolla di scomunica fa arrestare il pontefice che verr\\u00e0 trasferito in Francia, prima a Grenoble e poi a Fontainebleau. Il blocco \\u00e8 per\\u00f2 un insuccesso. Troppi gli Stati che lo aggirano, fra questi il Portogallo che per rappresaglia viene invaso. In seguito Napoleone approfitta della disputa dinastica tra Carlo IV e il figlio per costringere entrambi ad abdicare e porre sul trono di Spagna il fratello Giuseppe, senza per\\u00f2 riuscire a domare la guerriglia e nemmeno ad annientare il corpo di spedizione inglese che nel frattempo ha liberato lo Stato lusitano. Nonostante le difficolt\\u00e0, nel 1809 piega anche la quinta coalizione (ennesima alleanza fra Impero austriaco e Regno Unito), sconfitta dall\\u2019alto di una indiscussa superiorit\\u00e0 militare. Occupa Vienna e il castello di Sch\\u00f6nbrunn e detta agli austriaci una pace durissima. Intanto si accorda con il loro primo ministro Metternich per un matrimonio di stato in grado di conciliare definitivamente Francia e Austria e, sperabilmente, di regalare all\\u2019imperatore l\\u2019agognato erede maschio. Aveva divorziato da Giuseppina, adorata ma infedele compagna, ora impalma Maria Luisa d\\u2019Austria, nipote di Maria Antonietta. Ma il figlio che nasce nel 1811, Napoleone Francesco, detto il re di Roma, non salir\\u00e0 mai sul trono e morir\\u00e0 a soli 21 anni. Deciso ad assestare un colpo definitivo anche allo zar Alessandro, l\\u2019imperatore tenta l\\u2019invasione della Russia, un\\u2019impresa titanica che si chiuder\\u00e0 con una sconfitta epocale. I numeri non mentono: l\\u2019imperatore parte alla testa di un esercito di 700 mila uomini dei quali oltre 400 mila non faranno mai ritorno. La disfatta fa rialzare la testa alle potenze europee. Napoleone rientrato in Francia lavora notte e giorno a rimettere in piedi l\\u2019esercito, circa 400 mila effettivi, in gran parte giovani reclute. Al vecchio leone ferito bastano per tenere a bada i prussiani ma non il grosso della coalizione, compresi gli austriaci che non sembrano tenere in gran conto il matrimonio dell\\u2019anno precedente. L\\u2019esercito francese capitola a Lipsia. Napoleone affida la reggenza alla moglie e la capitale al fratello, quindi si mette alla testa di 60 mila veterani e per due mesi tiene a bada le forze nemiche, dovendo poi cedere ai prussiani. Il 31 marzo 1813 lo zar Alessandro entra a Parigi. Napoleone \\u00e8 costretto ad abdicare. Dopo un tentativo di suicidio con l\\u2019arsenico, miracolosamente sventato, e un commovente addio alla Vecchia Guardia, raggiunge Marsiglia e salpa per il suo confino all\\u2019Elba. Sull\\u2019isola sfoga il suo iperattivismo costruendo strade e infrastrutture e tiene un occhio vigile su Parigi dove Luigi XVIII, tornato sul trono dopo la sua abdicazione, si \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 alienato i favori del popolo. In fuga dall\\u2019Elba verso i leggendari \\u201ccento giorni\\u201d Dieci mesi di confino possono bastare. Fugge alla vigilanza inglese e il primo marzo 1815 sbarca ad Antibes: cominciano i leggendari \\u201ccento giorni\\u201d. In marcia verso Parigi solleva un inaspettato entusiasmo popolare: per convincere all\\u2019ammutinamento le truppe inviategli contro dal re basta la sua sola apparizione. Di nuovo sul trono, riorganizza l\\u2019esercito e promulga una costituzione pi\\u00f9 liberale. Lo aspetta il duello finale. Di fronte ha i nemici di sempre, Regno Unito e Prussia in prima fila. Progetta ancora di dividere le preponderanti forze avversarie, ma la manovra riesce solo parzialmente. Waterloo sar\\u00e0 l\\u2019ultimo capitolo dell\\u2019inimitabile storia militare del favoloso corso. Errori tattici e organizzativi decreteranno la storica disfatta del 18 giugno 1815, sulla quale pesa anche la scelta di generali non all\\u2019altezza. Trovato rifugio nel castello di Malmaison, Napoleone attende il suo destino: il 15 luglio si arrende agli inglesi. E convinto di poter vivere da privato cittadino in Inghilterra o negli Stati Uniti, lo aspetta invece l\\u2019ergastolo nella sperduta isola di Sant\\u2019Elena nell\\u2019Oceano Atlantico. In quel fazzoletto di terra, controllato a vista da un contingente inglese, l\\u2019uomo che era stato padrone d\\u2019Europa muore il 5 maggio 1821 alle ore 17:49, stroncato da un tumore allo stomaco. Sepolto sull\\u2019isola, la salma rientrer\\u00e0 a Parigi per un funerale solenne soltanto nel 1840. Dal 1861 riposa in una tomba monumentale nella Chiesa di Saint-Louis des Invalides. L\\u2019EREDIT\\u00c0 PI\\u00d9 GRANDE: IL CODICE NAPOLEONICO\\nDurante l\\u2019esilio nell\\u2019Isola di Sant\\u2019Elena, seguito alla sconfitta di Waterloo, Napoleone sottoline\\u00f2 pi\\u00f9 volte che la sua opera pi\\u00f9 importante, quella che sarebbe passata alla storia pi\\u00f9 delle battaglie vinte, sarebbe stato il Codice Napoleonico. Aveva ragione. Promulgato in 36 leggi il 21 marzo 1804 \\u2013 seguirono il Codice di procedura civile nel 1806 e il Codice di commercio nel 1807 \\u2013 fu il primo codice civile moderno, di cui Napoleone non fu solo l\\u2019ispiratore e il promotore ma ne condivise la redazione, affidata a quattro grandi giuristi. Si deve proprio a Napoleone, privo di nozioni giuridiche, la particolare chiarezza dell\\u2019articolato. Tutt\\u2019ora in vigore in Francia e Belgio, e modello per quello italiano e spagnolo, il Codice napoleonico confermava le maggiori conquiste della Rivoluzione Francese, pur distanziandosi dagli eccessi della legislazione del 1789-1804: l\\u2019uguaglianza giuridica di fronte alla legge, la libert\\u00e0 religiosa, il diritto di propriet\\u00e0 privata e la laicit\\u00e0 dello stato, ponendo fine ai retaggi dell\\u2019Anci\\u00e9n regime, del feudalesimo, dell\\u2019assolutismo, creando una societ\\u00e0 prevalentemente borghese.

Despite his robust health and seemingly divine status, Alexander\\u2019s sudden death at 32 in Babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership, plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the Wars of the Successors. While some historians suggest natural causes like disease, others propose theories of murder, fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death. Oliver Stone\\u2019s film Alexander reignited interest in these theories, suggesting a conspiracy among Alexander\\u2019s generals. Various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians. Despite extensive historical, forensic, and toxicological research, including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with Alexander\\u2019s symptoms, the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation, leaving one of history\\u2019s greatest mysteries unsolved. by James Romm In Babylon on June 11th, 323 BC, at about 5pm, Alexander the Great died aged 32, having conquered an empire stretching from modern Albania to eastern Pakistan. The question of what, or who, killed the Macedonian king has never been answered successfully. Today new theories are heating up one of history\\u2019s longest-running cold cases. Like the death of Stalin, to which it is sometimes compared, the death of Alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible. Conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king\\u2019s body was cold, but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects. Fuel was added to the fire by Oliver Stone\\u2018s Alexander, released in 2004 with new versions in 2006 and 2008: a film that, whatever its artistic flaws, presents a historically informed theory about who killed Alexander and why. Few events have been as unexpected as the death of Alexander. The king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his 12-year campaign through Asia, enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles. Some had come to think of him as divine, an idea fostered, and perhaps entertained, by Alexander himself. In 325, fighting almost single-handed against South Asian warriors, Alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow, yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches, a 60-day trek along the barren coast of southern Iran. Consequently, when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later, the shock felt by his 50,000-strong army was intense. So was the confusion about who would next lead it, for Alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir (though one would be born shortly after his death). The sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point, the start of a half-century of instability and strife known today as the Wars of the Successors. Events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes. It is disturbing to think that blind chance \\u2013 a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito \\u2013 put the ancient world on a perilous new course. An explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring, even though it involves a darker view of Alexander\\u2019s relations with his Companions, the inner circle of friends and high-ranking officers that surrounded him in Babylon. Ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of Alexander\\u2019s death, though many attribute it to disease. In 1996 Eugene Borza, a scholar specialising in ancient Macedon, took part in a medical board of inquiry at the University of Maryland, which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever; Borza has since defended that finding in print. Malaria, smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed, with alcoholism, infection from the lung wound and grief \\u2013 Alexander\\u2019s close friend Hephaestion had died some months earlier \\u2013 often seen as complicating factors. But some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness, or even to choose between illness or murder: two Alexander experts who once made this choice (one on each side) later changed their opinions to undecided. With historical research at an impasse, Alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches. Armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology, they are re-opening the Alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation. The idea that Alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in 2004, thanks to the ending of Stone\\u2019s film. In its epilogue Alexander\\u2019s senior general Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins), looking back over decades at his commander\\u2019s death, declares: \\u2018The truth is, we did kill him. By silence, we consented \\u2026 Because we couldn\\u2019t go on.\\u2019 Ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again. \\u2018You shall write: He died of disease, and in weakened condition.\\u2019 The idea that Alexander\\u2019s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of Stone\\u2019s famously plot-prone imagination. There is some evidence that not even Alexander\\u2019s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere. In India in 325 BC, at the eastern edge of the Indus river system, Alexander\\u2019s army staged a sit-down strike, when ordered to march eastward towards the Ganges. Even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny. Stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy, since Alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death. \\u2018I can\\u2019t believe that these men were going on with Alexander\\u2019 to Arabia and Carthage, he said in a 2008 interview at the University of California, Berkeley. Stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that Ptolemy masterminded a cover-up of Alexander\\u2019s murder, but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed. The account Ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of Alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the Royal Journals. Though now lost it was summarised (in different versions) by Arrian and Plutarch, two Greek writers of the Roman Empire, who endorsed it as the most reliable record of Alexander\\u2019s last days. Some scholars, led by the Australian classicist Brian Bosworth, believe the Royal Journals were falsified to make Alexander\\u2019s death appear natural, just as Stone\\u2019s film represents (though in Bosworth\\u2019s view the culprit was Eumenes, Alexander\\u2019s court secretary, rather than Ptolemy). Others disagree, taking the Journals to be just what Arrian and Plutarch thought they were, an undoctored, day-by-day eyewitness account. * * * * * * The debate over the Royal Journals has huge implications for our understanding of Alexander\\u2019s death, because Arrian and Plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources. Both authors say that Alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named Medius. His fever grew worse over the course of 10 or 12 days (the two accounts differ in chronology), leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak. As his troops shuffled past his sickbed, Arrian reports, Alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one. Death followed the next day. But a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that Stone followed in Alexander. In this alternate version Alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and, more importantly, just as he drained a huge cup of wine. These accounts say that Alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud. From that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms, including great pain, convulsions and delirium, but they say little or nothing about fever, the keynote of the Plutarch and Arrian accounts. A stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison, which is why Plutarch, in his biography of Alexander, vehemently denied that it had occurred. \\u2018Some writers think they have to say such things, as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama\\u2019, he sneered. Apparently the dispute between those who thought Alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder \\u2013 essentially, those who did or did not trust the Royal Journals \\u2013 was already rife in Plutarch\\u2019s day. Probably all reports of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely. For supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is, of course, \\u2018whodunnit?\\u2019 Stone\\u2019s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question. In the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the Companions to show that they know Alexander\\u2019s cup contains poison, but no clue is given as to how it got there. By contrast many Greek and Roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it, but how and with what poison. With remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at Antipater, the senior general whom Alexander had left in charge of the Macedonian homeland, and at two of his sons, Cassander and Iollas. Antipater may indeed have had reason to want Alexander dead in the spring of 323 BC, for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to Babylon, perhaps with hostile intent. Antipater stayed put but sent Cassander in his stead. According to several ancient accounts Antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water, collected from the legendary river Styx (believed to flow above ground in the northern Peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld). The water had to be transported in a hollowed-out mule\\u2019s hoof, for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn. In Babylon, ran the story, Cassander passed this mule\\u2019s hoof to his brother Iollas \\u2013 conveniently enough, Alexander\\u2019s wine-pourer \\u2013 who then slipped the toxin into the king\\u2019s drink. The basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling, but details vary. Some versions mention the philosopher Aristotle as a co-conspirator; he was a known friend of Antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student Alexander, who had sanctioned the death of his relative Callisthenes. Others make Medius, the host of the final, fatal dinner party and allegedly Iollas\\u2019 male lover, a participant in the plot. One very early version, published in an anonymous Greek pamphlet, now known as The Last Days and Testament of Alexander, made Iollas doubly guilty: when the first draught of poison failed to kill Alexander, Iollas administered a second, soaking in Styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit. Until recently historians dismissed the story of the Styx water-poisoning as a fiction, possibly a political smear designed to harm Antipater and Cassander. Both were contestants for power in the era after Alexander\\u2019s death and had many enemies, especially Olympias, Alexander\\u2019s vengeful mother (who, perhaps to help foster the idea of Antipater\\u2019s family\\u2019s guilt, eventually had Iollas\\u2019 grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind). Even the idea that ordinary Greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd. In 1913 the distinguished classicist J.G. Frazer declared that the waters the Greeks identified as the Styx, today called Blackwater or Mavroneri, contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century. But, in a presentation at a conference in Barcelona in 2010, the historian Adrienne Mayor and the toxicologist Antoinette Hayes proposed that the limestone around Mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin. Chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today (though they may have disappeared over the centuries). Mayor and Hayes argue that \\u2018calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for Alexander\\u2019 \\u2013 including his high fever, usually seen as proof of a natural death. The research of Mayor and Hayes might suggest that Alexander was murdered, though the authors themselves stop short of that claim. They are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself. Their thesis that the Styx really was strongly toxic would account for why Antipater and his sons were the ancient world\\u2019s prime suspects: Cassander\\u2019s journey from Europe to Babylon just a few weeks before the onset of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which Styx water could have arrived at the king\\u2019s banquet table. (Cassander later helped confirm the ancient world\\u2019s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of Macedonia and executing Alexander\\u2019s mother, wife and son.) The authors are also interested in how, in the Greek imagination, the mythic resonance of the Styx, a river thought able to stupefy even the gods, made it an ideal weapon for Antipater and his sons to use. \\u2018Such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to Alexander\\u2019, Mayor said recently. \\u2018An ordinary, common drug would not do. Only a very rare, potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for Alexander.\\u2019 It remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of Antipater\\u2019s conspiracy can help crack the mystery. But it is clear that the Mayor-Hayes approach, matching toxins available to the ancient world with Alexander\\u2019s reported symptoms, has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery. Three other investigators have pursued it in recent years, combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin: Ptolemy, one of Alexander\\u2019s leading generals, committed the murder with arsenic; Rhoxane, the king\\u2019s wife, did it with strychnine; Alexander\\u2019s physicians did it, but by accident, with powdered hellebore root. The last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the New Zealand toxicologist Leo Schep and the Scotland Yard detective John Grieve. These two men were brought together in a 2009 television documentary, Alexander the Great\\u2019s Mysterious Death. Schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore, used medicinally by the ancient Greeks but lethal in large doses, could best account for Alexander\\u2019s recorded symptoms. Grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin, as Schep had supposed, but by Alexander\\u2019s doctors, who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him. Grieve\\u2019s ingenious speculation is only that, but has already won the endorsement of at least one Alexander specialist, the British classicist Richard Stoneman. \\u2018Hellebore, despite its dangers, was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects\\u2019, Stoneman notes. \\u2018But it was easy to get the dose wrong, and Alexander\\u2019s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in Babylon \\u2013 or even misread the Babylonian label.\\u2019 But the toxicology on which Schep and Grieve rely is evidently not an exact science, especially when practiced at a distance of 2,300 years. The author Graham Phillips submitted the same record of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms as Schep\\u2019s to the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Center but obtained a very different answer. In his 2004 book Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon Phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like Alexander\\u2019s. Following a twisting, at times tortuous, trail of logic Phillips tries to identify Alexander\\u2019s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine. The poisonous plant is rare along Alexander\\u2019s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent (modern Pakistan). Not all of Alexander\\u2019s retinue followed him into such areas, allowing Phillips to eliminate potential suspects. He concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill Alexander also had the means: Rhoxane, the first of the king\\u2019s three wives. She had become enraged at Alexander, Phillips assumes, by his two subsequent marriages to Persian princesses and killed him. This view of Rhoxane as a latter-day Medea revives one popularised in the 17th-century English tragedy by Nataniel Lee, The Rival Queens, but is not supported by evidence. (Oliver Stone, too, portrays Rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman, though he makes her guilty of the death of Hephaestion \\u2013 in his view, Alexander\\u2019s male lover \\u2013 rather than Alexander himself.) Arsenic gets the spotlight in a 2004 book, The Death of Alexander the Great by Paul Doherty, novelist and amateur historian. Doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by Plutarch and the Roman writer Quintus Curtius: Alexander\\u2019s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of Babylon for a week or more. Doherty cites toxicology studies of the 19th century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification. However the jury seems to be out on this point and, for obvious reasons, opportunities for field tests are few. If Alexander\\u2019s body really did resist decomposition \\u2013 and some experts consider the story a fiction \\u2013 then numerous explanations have to be considered. Those who believe Alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol. Strychnine, hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents. Defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the non-decay phenomenon: Alexander, in their view, only appeared to die on June 11th; he actually entered a deep coma. He may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him. Doherty\\u2019s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at Ptolemy as its lead suspect. Ptolemy got the best post-Alexander assignment of any of the leading generals, a posting in wealthy Egypt. He eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries, until finally lost by his descendant Cleopatra in 30 BC. Doherty argues backward from Ptolemy\\u2019s later success, reasoning that he who gained the most from Alexander\\u2019s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about. It is the same thinking that Oliver Stone used when he made Ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in Alexander. As the director said in the Berkeley interview: \\u2018I go back to [the film] JFK: Cui bono? Who benefits?\\u2019 It is startling to think that Ptolemy or Rhoxane, two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to Alexander, may have wanted him dead, but those possibilities cannot be ruled out. Neither can Stone\\u2019s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in Alexander\\u2019s murder, at least by not intervening to prevent it (\\u2018By silence we consented\\u2019). Indeed John Atkinson, a South African classicist, has put forward a scenario very much like that of Stone\\u2019s film in a 2009 journal article entitled \\u2018Alexander\\u2019s Last Days: Malaria and Mind Games?\\u2019 (co-authored with two medical specialists, Elsie and Etienne Truter). Like Stone, Atkinson portrays an Alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates. \\u2018The officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap\\u2019, he and his co-authors write. \\u2018Men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger.\\u2019 In Atkinson\\u2019s view the campaigns Alexander had in mind in June 323 BC \\u2013 including conquest of Arabia, Carthage and the entire Mediterranean coast \\u2013 were a bridge too far for Alexander\\u2019s officers. Having turned him back from the East by mutiny, he argues, these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the West. Even while regarding Alexander as a pariah to his own people, Atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned, seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms. His verdict is something closer to euthanasia: after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the \\u2018mind games\\u2019 of the article\\u2019s title. \\u2018The officers in Alexander\\u2019s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive\\u2019, Atkinson writes. \\u2018Maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die.\\u2019 And so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions. Ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever, even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios. Mayor and Hayes raise the possibility that Alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered; John Grieve suspects he was poisoned, but by accident. Atkinson makes the case that Alexander\\u2019s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural, but something in between. If the embalmed body of Alexander is ever found \\u2013 and some researchers continue to hunt for it \\u2013 we may finally learn what caused his death, but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century AD (it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at Alexandria). Meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Justin and Quintus Curtius. Unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots. With physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the Alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories. Opponents of such theories have long noted that Alexander himself, during the 10 or 12 days he slid towards death, never gave any sign that he suspected poison, though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years. He would never have gone willingly to his death (as Oliver Stone\\u2019s film appears to imply), nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him. A slow decline would allow him to order their executions. To assert that Alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled. The same point could be made about what followed Alexander\\u2019s death. The chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination. If the goal of the generals was to \\u2018go home and spend their dough\\u2019, as Oliver Stone asserted in his Berkeley interview, they failed miserably. None ever returned to Macedonia and only Ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security. Many of the others continued fighting and killing each other. Given how central Alexander was to the stability of their world, they had no reason in June 323 BC to expect otherwise. Any plan to poison Alexander would have been fraught with perils, especially for Macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins. Conspiracy theories have to assume that Alexander\\u2019s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything. It is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them: as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king. Thus it is easier, in the end, to believe that Alexander died of disease, despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise. About the Author:\\nJames Romm is James H.

On 4 November 1979, the embassy was stormed by Iranian protestors, forcing Lijek, his wife and four others to seek refuge across the city as they awaited a daring rescue by Canada and the CIA. At 9am on Sunday 4 November 1979, Mark Lijek and his colleagues sat in shocked horror as hundreds of Iranian protestors climbed the gate of the US Embassy in Tehran. The attack was the embodiment of months of increased tension between Iran and the US, culminating in what would be one of the modern era\\u2019s highest-profile hostage crises. As the embassy fell into Iranian hands, however, Lijek and five others, including his wife, would become part of a remarkable escape plan to get out of the country. Their incredible story was retold in the Oscar-winning 2012 film Argo, but here Lijek tells us what really happened. Lijek served as a consular officer for the US Embassy in Tehran, while his wife Cora was a consular assistant working in the visa tourist office. \\u201cMost of the Americans worked in two buildings; the vast majority were in the Chancellery, which was in the south centre of the compound, and the rest of us worked in the consular annex, which was about a five-minute walk to the northwest,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201cOur compound was very large, 26 acres [10 hectares] and about a mile [1.6 kilometres] of wall, and we had 13 marines with orders not to shoot to defend the thing, so any kind of perimeter defence was out of the question. The plan was to try to hold onto our two buildings long enough to destroy sensitive information and equipment and wait for the hopeful rescue.\\u201d It quickly became apparent, though, that rescue was out of the question. \\u201cWe had one marine in our building and he pushed all the buttons, locked everything down, and we basically just sat there,\\u201d continues Lijek. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t see any of the demonstrators for about half an hour. Finally they worked their way up to our area and broke into this little courtyard that was immediately south of our building. \\u201cEventually, somebody noticed our building was not fully protected. It was brand new, we had all these latest security upgrades, but some genius had overlooked the upstairs bathroom windows. They were just normal glass, no bars, no nothing. So somebody tossed a brick through one of the windows and the marine ran in, and he saw a guy climbing up the ladder. He pushed the ladder away and tossed a tear gas canister into the ground below. A friend and I grabbed some of the metal coat hangers and we wired the doors together, but if they really wanted to break through they could have, and I\\u2019m not sure why we were left alone from that point on, but we sort of were.\\u201d It became a very nervous wait for Lijek and his colleagues. The electricity went off and they could hear footsteps on the roof but there was seemingly nothing they could do except sit in the dark and wait, which they did for two hours. \\u201cFinally we were told that we should try to get to the British compound,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cThere was no way for us to know whether we would be allowed to go, but given the circumstances we didn\\u2019t have much choice.\\u201d The marine opened the door and one of Lijek\\u2019s friends crept out, finding three policemen who didn\\u2019t have any objections to them leaving. The Iranian customers and\\u00a0employees in the building had already made a break to get home, leaving just 13 Americans behind. It was decided to split into two groups to increase their chances of success; the two married couples, Lijek and his wife being one, left in the first group of six with two civilian Americans who were there on business. \\u201cI assume they figured that we would have a slightly better chance of getting away if we went first, and in fact that\\u2019s how it turned out,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201dWe made it. That second group that left a few minutes after us did not, with the exception of one guy who actually caught up to me, this fella Bob Anders, our immigration chief.\\u201d In addition to the embassy swarming with protestors, the streets were alive with revolutionaries. \\u201dI was holding my breath because we knew at any time somebody could come up and stop us,\\u201d says Lijek, \\u201cand in fact that\\u2019s exactly what happened to that second group of Americans. They followed us but we came to the first major north-south street, and we turned south, which was the proper direction to go to the British compound. The second group, which included our boss, the consular general, decided to go to his house and play bridge instead, so they turned north. And apparently that little change in plan got them caught, because they got about 150 yards [135 metres] north and some guy with a G3 [rifle] came running after them, rounded them up and made them march back to the embassy.\\u201d Lijek and his group made their way to the British compound through the narrow city streets, but when they got to Ferdowsi Square, which was right in front of the compound, they came across a big demonstration that was blocking their path. Ducking into an alley, they held a quick meeting and decided the best course of action would be to go to Anders\\u2019 apartment and wait out the trouble. \\u201cYou have to remember, we\\u2019re still thinking all we\\u2019ve got to do is hide out for a few hours, we did not know that there would be no rescue,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cSo once we got to Bob\\u2019s place we were feeling pretty good. We sat around, had a nice lunch, had a few drinks, listened to the BBC describing the attack on the radio and we just thought by the end of the day it would probably be over and we\\u2019d be back at work tomorrow.\\u201d By 11pm, four of them, Lijek and his wife and the other couple, Joe and Kathy Stafford, made their way to the Iran-America Society to spend the night. The following day they were on the move again, this time finally to the British compound after a brief stop at the Staffords\\u2019 apartment, but all the while an uncooperative Washington was failing to give them details of exactly how bad things were. That Monday, 5 November, the British Embassy (separate from the British compound they were in) was attacked. \\u201cThe compound we were hiding in was visited by a mob that wanted to break in,\\u201d says Lijek \\u201cFrankly it was just a clever guard who talked them out of it. So London and Washington conferred and decided it was too risky for us to be with you.\\u201d Lijek had hoped they would be allowed to stay in the compound but instead they were told to move again. \\u201cAs it was, we did feel like we\\u2019d been abandoned,\\u201d he reveals. Virtually every neighbourhood had a revolutionary committee, known as a komiteh, and Lijek was fearful that it was only a matter of time before they were caught. The group were moved to a US Embassy house under the care of a Thai cook called Sam, but after a few days it became apparent that the housekeeper, an elderly Thai lady, was not comfortable with them being there. After a row between Sam and her on 10 November, she left the house in a foul mood, and the Americans were worried she would alert the local komiteh to their presence. Fortunately, Anders had been in contact with his Canadian counterpart, John Sheardown, who insisted they join him at his residence at the Canadian Embassy, which hadn\\u2019t been touched by the Iranians. At the Sheardown residence they were able to relax, to an extent. As Americans who had been in the US Embassy they were still unable to leave the country knowing that the Iranians would almost certainly hold them captive, along with the 52 other American hostages. The Canadians were extremely welcoming, however, and Prime Minister Joe Clark sanctioned their stay, unbeknown to the Iranians, of course. They would end up remaining there for two months and, while not uncomfortable, it was not without peril. \\u201cIn terms of specific threats, one really was John\\u2019s gardener,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201cHe was a member of the local komiteh and we needed to be sure he did not see us, and that was kind of a problem because John\\u2019s house had a lot of glass walls, and the gardener had a key and could show up whenever he wanted. There were other little things, like the garbage; John had to start getting rid of the excess garbage because all of a sudden instead of three people in the house you\\u2019ve got seven [an additional member of the group was added, who had been hiding with the Swedes, while the Staffords were in a residence nearby]. The garbage man was also a member of the komiteh, so John had to start carrying the garbage to work. The other thing that happened was that the house was put up for sale by the landlord, so from time to time people would come to look and we would have to evacuate on those days. But we didn\\u2019t like going outside, we were kind of paranoid for a range of reasons. On one of those trips the car skidded off the road in the snow and a bunch of Iranians came and helped us pick it up and put it back on the road. That was really nice of them but, I mean, it was outside of my comfort zone! It\\u2019s not that I expected everybody to know my face or whatever, it\\u2019s not like they were putting up wanted posters, but we were paranoid and these things were not helpful.\\u201d By January, Lijek\\u2019s group was getting restless, so they asked the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor to relay a message to Washington asking for help to leave Iran. But it would not be until late January that it became apparent that a plan was afoot to get them out. The CIA had put together a fake science-fiction movie called Argo, complete with posters, a script and press releases, and the plan was to pretend the group were Hollywood employees out in Tehran shooting a movie. \\u201dWe didn\\u2019t really know anything about the CIA or the specifics of the plan until 26 January when [CIA agent] Tony Mendez and his partner, Julio, came to the house in the evening,\\u201d explains Lijek. \\u201dWe were briefed on three possible options [for escape]: one of course was the Hollywood scenario, but it was pretty obvious from the way Tony presented them that the other two were throwaways. One, I think, had us as agronomists or something like that, and the other I think we were people involved in a petroleum venture. The Hollywood thing was definitely audacious but it had a certain credibility, frankly, because who else is going to show up in a country in the middle of a revolution and realistically expect that they can get their work done? Hollywood people have a bit of a detachment from reality, it seems, and frankly they also have a certain carte blanche that maybe they can actually get cooperation from this revolutionary regime.\\u201d Lijek and his group were mostly behind the plan. They were each given roles to play; Lijek was the transportation coordinator for the \\u2018movie\\u2019, his wife the scriptwriter, and so on. They were given new identities, new passports and told to alter their appearance. However, one member of their group, Joe Stafford, did not like the plan at all. \\u201cHe thought we had a moral obligation to stay until the hostages were released, which to me made no sense,\\u201d says Lijek. Stafford\\u2019s refusal to cooperate threatened to derail the entire mission. Thankfully, in the morning of 27 January, the plan was put into motion and it worked perfectly. Unlike the 2012 movie, their journey to and through the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran was largely uneventful, apart from a brief delay for their plane. There was no final chase down the runway like the film portrayed. Indeed, the plan went so well that Lijek admits it was probably more for their own benefit than the Iranians: \\u201cWhat Tony told me later was that the cover story was created basically for us,\\u201d explains Lijek \\u201cA professional immigrations customers officer is trained to detect nervous behaviour, so the thing Tony didn\\u2019t want was for us to be nervous, so he needed us to believe in the scenario. We made a game of it, and with the exception of Joe we were having fun.\\u201d Aside from the inconvenience with their plane being delayed for half an hour, the group ultimately boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich on the morning of Sunday 27 January 1980, finally bringing the ordeal they had endured for nearly three months to a close. \\u201cOnce we got out of Iranian airspace it was a tremendous relief,\\u201d says Lijek. \\u201cWe toasted each other and it was an amazing moment. It\\u2019s kind of hard to describe, there were just so many different emotions, including concern about the hostages we were leaving behind, but for ourselves it was like magic. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve ever had any emotions to really compare to the freedom of getting out after three months of living with daily stress, finally it just all of a sudden goes away. It was incredible.\\u201d Although they managed to escape relatively trouble free, not everyone was sure they would make it out of the country so easily, and one man who remained uncertain was President Carter, who later said the Argo six\\u2019 had just a fifty-fifty chance of successfully leaving Iran. \\u201cI\\u2019m surprised he would have launched the operation with only a 50 per cent chance of success,\\u201d admits Lijek. \\u201dI did ask Tony about that and he denied it, he said he figured we were at least 75-25 in favour, and that\\u2019s kind of what I would have thought at the point when the proposal was put to us in Tehran. \\u201cIf Tony had told us we had a fifty-fifty chance, I don\\u2019t think we would have voted [to go]. One thing I did learn from the [2012 film Argo] was the risk we were running. It didn\\u2019t occur to me at the time that if they caught us at the airport with false documents and a CIA escort, you know we are spies at that point, and so who knows what they would do. That never really occurred to me until the movie came out.\\u201d Thankfully, the escape went according to plan, but while Lijek and his group were free in the USA by early 1980, the ordeal was far from over for the 52 other Americans who were still being held hostage in Iran. They would not be freed until a year later, on 20 January 1981, after Iraq invaded and forced Iran to enter negotiations with the US. Had the \\u2018Argo six\\u2019 left the embassy just a few minutes later on the day it was stormed, on 4 November 1979, it\\u2019s almost certain they would have joined this group of hostages in captivity. However, they were able to evade capture and make it out of the country, thanks in no small part to the help from Canada, a gesture widely heralded across the United States. Such was Canada\\u2019s role alongside the CIA that the rescue of the \\u2018Argo six\\u2019 is now known as the Canadian Caper, and this daring and bizarre rescue mission will not soon be forgotten. \\u00a0 * * * In the year leading up to the uprising, tensions between Iran and the United States had escalated when Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (or ruler) of Iran, was admitted to the US for cancer treatment. In February 1979, he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, leaving a provisional government in place. This government failed to quell the revolution and ultimately, on 4 November 1979, another uprising saw a group of Iranian students take over the US Embassy in Tehran. Although Lijek\\u2019s group escaped within a few months, 52 other Americans were held hostage until 20 January 1981, when they were released as a result of Iraq invading Iran in September 1980.

He lent his name to ambition and did so in a minimal amount of time. In the handful of years between Austerlitz and Waterloo, he took the world. When defeated, he had marked it forever. Then, from the exile of Saint Helena, he soared into legend. It all began on another island, Corsica, where the future general was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio to a family of ancient and noble Tuscan origins: his father Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, a lawyer, and his mother Maria Letizia Ramolino, a descendant of a wealthy Italian family. At ten, a scholarship opened the doors to the exclusive military school of Brienne-le-Ch\\u00e2teau in northern France, where the offspring of high lineage learned the art of war. It was five years of study and reading, and also of taunts: his classmates didn\\u2019t forgive his Corsican origin and his halting French. Napoleon emerged with a quarrelsome and solitary disposition and a strong spirit of revenge, pride bolstered by a bitter anti-French resentment. His military career progressed rapidly: in 1784, he moved to the Royal School of Paris, and at just sixteen years old, he was assigned to an artillery regiment stationed at La F\\u00e8re in Picardy. When the revolution broke out in 1789, Napoleon joined and obtained a leave to return to Corsica, hoping the new upheavals could benefit the island\\u2019s cause. However, he had to flee in 1793 with his family after breaking with the independence front. In Paris, the revolution had already led to the Reign of Terror, and the guillotine was in full swing. Appointed captain, he was sent by the Committee of Public Health to suppress dissent in Marseille, later taking command of the troops in Toulon, where monarchists, supported by the English, had entrenched themselves. The young officer brilliantly resolved the city\\u2019s siege, exhibiting artillery force management that already revealed the genius strategist. A success that earned him the rank of brigade general and the attention of future Directory member Paul Barras, who two years later, on October 5, 1795, appointed him commander of the Paris garrison: Napoleon saved the National Convention by quelling the royalist uprising in blood. He was named general of the Army Corps of the Interior: at only 26 years old, he was a rapidly rising star. Marriage to Josephine and the Italian Triumphs In the Capital, the young Corsican met the high society: he went to the theater, organized dinners, and stepped into the influential salons. He was captivated by the charm of Josephine Tasher, widow Beauharnais, a great lady with a thousand connections, older than him, in debt, but still the owner of a rich income. She bet on the magnetic-eyed soldier; he on a refined woman capable of polishing his manners. On March 9, 1796, he married her and, on the 27th of the same month, was already in Nice commanding the Army of Italy, ready to battle Austria, the leader of the coalition among the major European monarchies terrified by the specter of the \\u201crevolutionary plague.\\u201d The campaign began on April 12; on May 14, Napoleon entered Milan as a conqueror. In just over a month, the young military man, having delivered to legend, took everyone by surprise by attacking from Liguria, dividing the enemy front, and routing first the Piedmontese and then the Austrians of the old general Beaulieu, literally at the mercy of the rival\\u2019s strategic choices. Leading an exhausted, poorly paid, scarcely equipped, outnumbered army, Napoleon accomplished his first masterpiece, built on the innovative management of troops, meticulous preparation of battles, selection of officers as courageous and bold as him, and the ability to revitalize the army by instilling a common sentiment that becomes a shared dream of glory when the bond between troop and leader solidifies into fanatic devotion to the commander. In Italy, Napoleon discovered he had greatness equal to his ambition. And he began to serve both. On August 5 at Castiglione delle Stiviere, he won his first major field battle, pushing to Venice and forcing Austria to the Treaty of Campoformio. Crowned with the laurel of the victor, he became politically cumbersome in France. The Directory preferred to distance him from Paris by entrusting him with the occupation of Egypt, aimed at countering British economic interests in the seas. The campaign was a failure: despite the victorious Battle of the Pyramids fought on July 21, 1798, the commander had to witness the complete destruction of the fleet by the hands of English Admiral Horatio Nelson and surrender to the impossibility of taking the ancient Crusader fortress of Saint John of Acre. Returning home, he found the Directory in crisis and the army in tatters. There was no choice but a coup. On November 9, 1799 (according to the revolutionary calendar, 18 Brumaire), Bonaparte dissolved the Chambers, power passed to three consuls who introduced a new constitution, then ratified by a plebiscite. Appointed First Consul, the general had the country in his hands and shaped it on a model of strong administrative centralization: the country was divided into departments with the new figure of the prefect at the helm. He also resolved the long-standing dispute with the Church, signing the concordat that established the state\\u2019s secularity. He founded the National Bank and reorganized the educational system, including the lyc\\u00e9e, the forge of the new ruling class. But if France was his, Italy was slipping away. The second anti-French coalition had overturned some of the republics born from the first expedition, so the First Consul returned to war and victory, first at Montebello and then at Marengo, on June 14, 1800. From the triumph was born, in 1802, the Italian Republic, of which Bonaparte became president, while the Treaty of Amiens signed with the United Kingdom granted two years of respite to Europe. At Notre-Dame, in 1804, Napoleon received from Pope Pius VII the crown of French emperor; the following year in Milan, in the Duomo, he placed the Iron Crown of King of Italy on his head. French Emperor and King of Italy At the height of glory and power, he targeted England. But the planned invasion of the island clashed with the disproportion of naval forces and foundered after the annihilation of the fleet at Trafalgar by Nelson. In 1805, Napoleon faced the third anti-French coalition, which this time involved England, Austria, and Russia, sending his most valiant marshal, Andrea Massena, to \\u201cdisturb\\u201d the Austrians in Italy, while he personally took command of the \\u201cGrande Arm\\u00e9e.\\u201d It was the eve of Austerlitz, Bonaparte\\u2019s strategic masterpiece: on December 3, 1805, on the anniversary of his coronation, he defeated the Austro-Russians. The following year he also defeated Frederick William II\\u2019s Prussia at Jena and made his triumphant entrance into Berlin. In 1807 at Friedland, the army of Tsar Alexander capitulated. Practically unbeatable, leading an army drunk with success, the emperor now imposed the Continental Blockade, forbidding ships flying the English flag from docking at any port, thus hoping to bend the British economy. To the pope who refused to adhere, he responded with the capture of Rome and the annexation of the Papal States to the empire, and when the excommunication bull arrived, he had the pontiff arrested, who was then transferred to France, first to Grenoble and then to Fontainebleau. The blockade, however, was a failure. Too many states circumvented it, including Portugal, which was invaded in retaliation. Napoleon then took advantage of the dynastic dispute between Charles IV and his son to force both to abdicate and place his brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, without, however, managing to tame the guerrillas or even to annihilate the English expeditionary force that in the meantime had liberated the Lusitanian state. Despite the difficulties, in 1809 he also bent the fifth coalition (yet another alliance between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom), defeated from a position of undisputed military superiority. He occupied Vienna and the Sch\\u00f6nbrunn Castle and dictated a harsh peace to the Austrians. Meanwhile, he agreed with their prime minister Metternich on a state marriage capable of definitively reconciling France and Austria and, hopefully, of granting the emperor the longed-for male heir. He had divorced Josephine, his beloved but unfaithful companion, and now married Maria Luisa of Austria, niece of Marie Antoinette. But the son born in 1811, Napoleon Francis, known as the King of Rome, would never ascend the throne and would die at just 21 years old. Determined to strike a final blow against Tsar Alexander, the Emperor attempted the invasion of Russia, a titanic endeavor that ended in an epochal defeat. The numbers don\\u2019t lie: the Emperor set off at the head of an army of 700,000 men, of which over 400,000 would never return. The defeat gave rise to the European powers. Napoleon, back in France, worked night and day to rebuild the army, about 400,000 strong, largely young recruits. The wounded old lion was enough to keep the Prussians at bay, but not the bulk of the coalition, including the Austrians, who did not seem to greatly respect the previous year\\u2019s marriage. The French army capitulated at Leipzig. Napoleon entrusted the regency to his wife and the capital to his brother, then took the lead of 60,000 veterans and for two months kept the enemy forces at bay, eventually yielding to the Prussians. On March 31, 1813, Tsar Alexander entered Paris. Napoleon was forced to abdicate. After an attempted suicide with arsenic, miraculously thwarted, and a moving farewell to the Old Guard, he reached Marseille and sailed for his exile on Elba. On the island, he vented his hyperactivity by building roads and infrastructure and kept a watchful eye on Paris where Louis XVIII, back on the throne after his abdication, had already alienated the favor of the people. Fleeing from Elba to the legendary \\u2018Hundred Days\\u2019 Ten months of confinement were enough. He escaped British surveillance and on March 1, 1815, landed at Antibes: the legendary \\u2018Hundred Days\\u2019 began. Marching towards Paris, he raised unexpected popular enthusiasm: his mere appearance was enough to persuade the troops sent against him by the king to mutiny. Back on the throne, he reorganized the army and promulgated a more liberal constitution. The final duel awaited him. He faced his usual enemies, with the United Kingdom and Prussia at the forefront. He still planned to divide the predominant opposing forces, but the maneuver only partially succeeded. Waterloo would be the last chapter of the inimitable military history of the fabulous Corsican. Tactical and organizational errors would decree the historic defeat of June 18, 1815, also weighed down by the choice of generals not up to the task. Having found refuge in the Ch\\u00e2teau de Malmaison, Napoleon awaited his fate: on July 15, he surrendered to the British. Convinced he could live as a private citizen in England or the United States, he instead faced life imprisonment on the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. On that speck of land, closely watched by a British contingent, the man who had been master of Europe died on May 5, 1821, at 17:49, struck down by stomach cancer. Buried on the island, his body was only returned to Paris for a solemn funeral in 1840. Since 1861, he rests in a monumental tomb in the Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides. THE GREATEST LEGACY: THE NAPOLEONIC CODE\\nDuring his exile on the Island of Saint Helena, following the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon often emphasized that his most important work, the one that would go down in history more than his military victories, would be the Napoleonic Code. He was right. Promulgated in 36 laws on March 21, 1804 \\u2013 followed by the Code of Civil Procedure in 1806 and the Commercial Code in 1807 \\u2013 it was the first modern civil code, of which Napoleon was not only the inspirer and promoter but also shared in its drafting, entrusted to four great jurists. It is thanks to Napoleon, who lacked legal knowledge, that the Code is noted for its particular clarity. Still in force in France and Belgium, and a model for the Italian and Spanish codes, the Napoleonic Code confirmed the major achievements of the French Revolution, while distancing itself from the excesses of the legislation from 1789-1804: legal equality before the law, religious freedom, the right to private property, and the secularism of the state, putting an end to the legacies of the Ancien R\\u00e9gime, feudalism, absolutism, creating a predominantly bourgeois society. NAPOLEON ACCORDING TO RIDLEY SCOTT\\u2019S FILM\\nThe unfulfilled dream of Stanley Kubrick was realized by Ridley Scott, who, over twenty years after Gladiator, finds his \\u201cemperor\\u201d Joaquin Phoenix again, this time in the role of Napoleon, in the biopic produced by Apple Original and distributed by Sony Pictures, one of the most anticipated films of fall 2023. Vanessa Kirby, skyrocketed to fame after her role in The Crown, portrays the first wife of the French emperor, Josephine Bonaparte. The cast also includes Tahar Rahim, Scott Caine, Ben Miles, and Paul Rhys. The film retraces Bonaparte\\u2019s unstoppable rise to power through his tumultuous relationship with his only true love, Josephine, showcasing the visionary political and military strategies of the great leader, in some of the most realistic and spectacular battle scenes ever made. The screenplay is written by David Scarpa, who had previously collaborated with Scott on All the Money in the World. Conoscere la Storia, December/January 2024 * * * ORIGINAL ITALIAN ARTICLE: L\\u2019irresistibile ascesa e la repentina caduta dell\\u2019uomo che sconvolse l\\u2019Europa in meno di vent\\u2019anni di Mario Galloni Da ufficiale d\\u2019artiglieria a generale, poi re e infine imperatore. Napoleone Bonaparte \\u00e8 stato tutto: genio militare, politico, giurista, talento creativo sostenuto da un dinamismo senza pari. Ha dato il suo nome all\\u2019ambizione e lo ha fatto in un tempo minimo. In quel pugno di anni che separano Austerlitz da Waterloo si \\u00e8 preso il mondo. Quando, sconf\\u00ectto, lo ha restituito, la sua impronta l\\u2019aveva segnato per sempre. Poi dall\\u2019esilio di Sant\\u2019Elena ha spiccato il volo nella leggenda. Tutto era cominciato su un\\u2019altra isola, la Corsica, dove il futuro generale nasce il 15 agosto 1769 ad Ajaccio da una famiglia di antiche e nobili origini toscane: il padre Giuseppe Maria Buonaparte, avvocato, la madre Maria Letizia Ramolino, discendente di un\\u2019agiata casata italiana. A dieci anni una borsa di studio gli spalanca le porte dell\\u2019esclusiva scuola militare di Brienne-le-Ch\\u00e2teau, nord della Francia, dove imparano l\\u2019arte della guerra i pargoli di alto lignaggio. Sar\\u00e0 un lustro di studio e letture, e anche di sberleffi: i compagni non gli perdonano l\\u2019origine corsa e quel francese zoppicante. Napoleone ne uscir\\u00e0 con una disposizione d\\u2019animo scontrosa e solitaria e un forte spirito di rivalsa, l\\u2019orgoglio rafforzato da un acre risentimento antifrancese. La carriera militare procede spedita: nel 1784 passa alla Regia scuola di Parigi e a soli sedici anni viene assegnato ad un reggimento di artiglieria di stanza a La F\\u00e8re, in Piccardia. Quando scoppia la rivoluzione, nel 1789, Napoleone aderisce e ottiene una licenza per tornare in Corsica, sperando che i nuovi fermenti possano giovare alla causa dell\\u2019isola. Dovr\\u00e0 invece fuggire nel 1793 con tutta la famiglia dopo aver rotto con il fronte indipendentista. A Parigi la rivoluzione \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 sfociata nel Terrore, la ghigliottina lavora a pieno regime. Nominato capitano, viene inviato dal Comitato di Salute Pubblica a reprimere il dissenso a Marsiglia, in seguito prender\\u00e0 il comando delle truppe a Tolone, dove i monarchici, sostenuti dagli inglesi, si sono trincerati. Il giovane ufficiale risolve brillantemente l\\u2019assedio della citt\\u00e0, esibendo una gestione delle forze d\\u2019artiglieria che gi\\u00e0 rivela il geniale stratega. Un successo che gli vale la nomina a generale di brigata e l\\u2019attenzione del futuro membro del Direttorio Paul Barras, che due anni dopo, il 5 ottobre 1795, lo nomina comandante della piazza di Parigi: Napoleone salva la Convenzione nazionale soffocando nel sangue la rivolta monarchica. Arriva la nomina a generale del Corpo d\\u2019armata dell\\u2019Interno: a soli 26 anni \\u00e8 una stella in rapida ascesa. Il matrimonio con Giuseppina e i trionfi italiani Nella Capitale il giovane corso incontra il gran mondo: va a teatro, organizza cene e mette piede nei salotti che contano. Rimane stregato dal fascino di Giuseppina Tasher, vedova Beauharnais, gran signora dalle mille relazioni, pi\\u00f9 grande di lui, indebitata, ma pur sempre titolare di una ricca rendita: lei scommette su quel militare dallo sguardo magnetico, lui su una donna raffinata in grado di ripulirne modi e maniere. Il 9 marzo 1796 la sposa e il 27 dello stesso mese \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 a Nizza al comando dell\\u2019Armata d\\u2019Italia pronta a dar battaglia all\\u2019Austria, capofila della coalizione tra le maggiori monarchie europee terrorizzate dallo spettro della \\u201cpeste rivoluzionaria\\u201d. La campagna comincia il 12 aprile; il 14 maggio Napoleone entra da trionfatore a Milano. In poco pi\\u00f9 di un mese, consegnato alla leggenda, il giovane militare ha spiazzato tutti attaccando dalla Liguria, diviso il fronte nemico e sbaragliato prima i piemontesi e poi gli austriaci del vecchio generale Beaulieu, letteralmente in balia delle scelte strategiche del rivale. A capo di un esercito infiacchito, mal pagato, scarsamente equipaggiato, inferiore di numero, Napoleone ha compiuto il suo primo capolavoro, costruito sulla gestione innovativa delle truppe, la meticolosa preparazione degli scontri, la scelta di ufficiali coraggiosi e spavaldi quanto lui, la capacit\\u00e0 di rivitalizzare l\\u2019esercito consegnando agli uomini un comune sentire che diventa sogno di gloria condiviso quando il rapporto tra truppa e condottiero si salda al punto da diventare devozione fanatica al condottiero. Napoleone in Italia scopre dunque di avere una grandezza pari alla sua ambizione. E comincia a servire entrambe. Il 5 agosto a Castiglione delle Stiviere vince la sua prima grande battaglia campale spingendosi fino a Venezia e costringendo l\\u2019Austria al trattato di Campoformio. Cinto dall\\u2019alloro del trionfatore, in Francia diventa politicamente ingombrante. Il Direttorio preferisce allontanarlo da Parigi affidandogli l\\u2019occupazione dell\\u2019Egitto, volta a contrastare gli interessi economici inglesi sui mari. La campagna sar\\u00e0 un fallimento: nonostante la vittoriosa battaglia delle Piramidi combattuta il 21 luglio 1798, il condottiero dovr\\u00e0 assistere alla completa distruzione della flotta per mano dell\\u2019ammiraglio inglese Horatio Nelson e arrendersi all\\u2019impossibilit\\u00e0 di prendere l\\u2019antica fortezza crociata di San Giovanni d\\u2019Acri. Fatto ritorno in patria, trova il Direttorio in crisi e l\\u2019esercito a pezzi. Non resta che il colpo di stato. Il 9 novembre 1799 (secondo il calendario rivoluzionario, 18 brumaio) Bonaparte fa sciogliere le Camere, il potere passa a tre consoli che varano una nuova costituzione, poi ratificata da un plebiscito. Fattosi nominare Primo Console, il generale ha in mano il Paese e lo modella sul modello di un forte accentramento amministrativo: il Paese viene diviso in dipartimenti con a capo la nuova figura del prefetto. Chiude anche l\\u2019annoso contenzioso con la Chiesa, siglando il concordato che sancisce la laicit\\u00e0 dello Stato. Fonda la Banca nazionale e riorganizza il sistema scolastico dove trova spazio il liceo, fucina della nuova classe dirigente. Ma se la Francia \\u00e8 sua, l\\u2019Italia gli sta sfuggendo. La seconda coalizione antifrancese ha rovesciato parte delle repubbliche figlie della prima spedizione, cos\\u00ec il Primo Console torna alla guerra e alla vittoria, prima a Montebello e poi a Marengo, il 14 giugno 1800. Dal trionfo nasce, nel 1802, la Repubblica italiana di cui Bonaparte diviene presidente, mentre il trattato di Amiens stipulato con il Regno Unito regala due anni di tregua all\\u2019Europa. A Notre-Dame, nel 1804, Napoleone riceve da papa Pio VII la corona di imperatore francese; l\\u2019anno dopo a Milano, in Duomo, cinge quella Ferrea di re d\\u2019Italia. Imperatore francese e re d\\u2019Italia All\\u2019apice della gloria e del potere, mette nel mirino l\\u2019Inghilterra. Ma la progettata invasione dell\\u2019isola si scontra con la sproporzione delle forze navali e naufraga dopo l\\u2019annientamento, a Trafalgar, della flotta a opera ancora di Nelson. Nel 1805 Napoleone fronteggia quindi la terza coalizione antifrancese che stavolta vede impegnate Inghilterra, Austria e Russia, spedendo il suo pi\\u00f9 valente maresciallo, Andrea Massena, a \\u201cdisturbare\\u201d gli austriaci in Italia, mentre in persona assume il comando della \\u201cGrande Armata\\u201d. \\u00c8 la vigilia di Austerlitz, capolavoro strategico di Bonaparte: il 3 dicembre 1805, nell\\u2019anniversario della sua incoronazione, sbaraglia gli austro-russi. L\\u2019anno seguente sconf\\u00ecgge anche la Prussia di Federico Guglielmo II a Jena e fa il suo trionfale ingresso a Berlino. Nel 1807 a Friedland capitola l\\u2019esercito dello zar Alessandro. Praticamente imbattibile, alla testa di un\\u2019armata ebbra di successi, l\\u2019imperatore impone ora il blocco continentale, vietando alle navi battenti bandiera inglese l\\u2019attracco in qualsiasi porto, auspicando cos\\u00ec di piegare l\\u2019economia britannica. Al papa che rifiuta di aderirvi risponde con la presa di Roma e l\\u2019annessione dello Stato pontificio all\\u2019impero e quando arriva la bolla di scomunica fa arrestare il pontefice che verr\\u00e0 trasferito in Francia, prima a Grenoble e poi a Fontainebleau. Il blocco \\u00e8 per\\u00f2 un insuccesso. Troppi gli Stati che lo aggirano, fra questi il Portogallo che per rappresaglia viene invaso. In seguito Napoleone approfitta della disputa dinastica tra Carlo IV e il figlio per costringere entrambi ad abdicare e porre sul trono di Spagna il fratello Giuseppe, senza per\\u00f2 riuscire a domare la guerriglia e nemmeno ad annientare il corpo di spedizione inglese che nel frattempo ha liberato lo Stato lusitano. Nonostante le difficolt\\u00e0, nel 1809 piega anche la quinta coalizione (ennesima alleanza fra Impero austriaco e Regno Unito), sconfitta dall\\u2019alto di una indiscussa superiorit\\u00e0 militare. Occupa Vienna e il castello di Sch\\u00f6nbrunn e detta agli austriaci una pace durissima. Intanto si accorda con il loro primo ministro Metternich per un matrimonio di stato in grado di conciliare definitivamente Francia e Austria e, sperabilmente, di regalare all\\u2019imperatore l\\u2019agognato erede maschio. Aveva divorziato da Giuseppina, adorata ma infedele compagna, ora impalma Maria Luisa d\\u2019Austria, nipote di Maria Antonietta. Ma il figlio che nasce nel 1811, Napoleone Francesco, detto il re di Roma, non salir\\u00e0 mai sul trono e morir\\u00e0 a soli 21 anni. Deciso ad assestare un colpo definitivo anche allo zar Alessandro, l\\u2019imperatore tenta l\\u2019invasione della Russia, un\\u2019impresa titanica che si chiuder\\u00e0 con una sconfitta epocale. I numeri non mentono: l\\u2019imperatore parte alla testa di un esercito di 700 mila uomini dei quali oltre 400 mila non faranno mai ritorno. La disfatta fa rialzare la testa alle potenze europee. Napoleone rientrato in Francia lavora notte e giorno a rimettere in piedi l\\u2019esercito, circa 400 mila effettivi, in gran parte giovani reclute. Al vecchio leone ferito bastano per tenere a bada i prussiani ma non il grosso della coalizione, compresi gli austriaci che non sembrano tenere in gran conto il matrimonio dell\\u2019anno precedente. L\\u2019esercito francese capitola a Lipsia. Napoleone affida la reggenza alla moglie e la capitale al fratello, quindi si mette alla testa di 60 mila veterani e per due mesi tiene a bada le forze nemiche, dovendo poi cedere ai prussiani. Il 31 marzo 1813 lo zar Alessandro entra a Parigi. Napoleone \\u00e8 costretto ad abdicare. Dopo un tentativo di suicidio con l\\u2019arsenico, miracolosamente sventato, e un commovente addio alla Vecchia Guardia, raggiunge Marsiglia e salpa per il suo confino all\\u2019Elba. Sull\\u2019isola sfoga il suo iperattivismo costruendo strade e infrastrutture e tiene un occhio vigile su Parigi dove Luigi XVIII, tornato sul trono dopo la sua abdicazione, si \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 alienato i favori del popolo. In fuga dall\\u2019Elba verso i leggendari \\u201ccento giorni\\u201d Dieci mesi di confino possono bastare. Fugge alla vigilanza inglese e il primo marzo 1815 sbarca ad Antibes: cominciano i leggendari \\u201ccento giorni\\u201d. In marcia verso Parigi solleva un inaspettato entusiasmo popolare: per convincere all\\u2019ammutinamento le truppe inviategli contro dal re basta la sua sola apparizione. Di nuovo sul trono, riorganizza l\\u2019esercito e promulga una costituzione pi\\u00f9 liberale. Lo aspetta il duello finale. Di fronte ha i nemici di sempre, Regno Unito e Prussia in prima fila. Progetta ancora di dividere le preponderanti forze avversarie, ma la manovra riesce solo parzialmente. Waterloo sar\\u00e0 l\\u2019ultimo capitolo dell\\u2019inimitabile storia militare del favoloso corso. Errori tattici e organizzativi decreteranno la storica disfatta del 18 giugno 1815, sulla quale pesa anche la scelta di generali non all\\u2019altezza. Trovato rifugio nel castello di Malmaison, Napoleone attende il suo destino: il 15 luglio si arrende agli inglesi. E convinto di poter vivere da privato cittadino in Inghilterra o negli Stati Uniti, lo aspetta invece l\\u2019ergastolo nella sperduta isola di Sant\\u2019Elena nell\\u2019Oceano Atlantico. In quel fazzoletto di terra, controllato a vista da un contingente inglese, l\\u2019uomo che era stato padrone d\\u2019Europa muore il 5 maggio 1821 alle ore 17:49, stroncato da un tumore allo stomaco. Sepolto sull\\u2019isola, la salma rientrer\\u00e0 a Parigi per un funerale solenne soltanto nel 1840. Dal 1861 riposa in una tomba monumentale nella Chiesa di Saint-Louis des Invalides.

Despite his robust health and seemingly divine status, Alexander\\u2019s sudden death at 32 in Babylon shocked his empire and left a void of leadership, plunging the region into a tumultuous period known as the Wars of the Successors. While some historians suggest natural causes like disease, others propose theories of murder, fueled by the suspicious circumstances and political intrigue surrounding his death. Oliver Stone\\u2019s film Alexander reignited interest in these theories, suggesting a conspiracy among Alexander\\u2019s generals. Various hypotheses range from poisoning by rivals or discontented officers to accidental overdose by his own physicians. Despite extensive historical, forensic, and toxicological research, including novel approaches that match ancient toxins with Alexander\\u2019s symptoms, the true cause of his demise remains a matter of speculation, leaving one of history\\u2019s greatest mysteries unsolved. by James Romm In Babylon on June 11th, 323 BC, at about 5pm, Alexander the Great died aged 32, having conquered an empire stretching from modern Albania to eastern Pakistan. The question of what, or who, killed the Macedonian king has never been answered successfully. Today new theories are heating up one of history\\u2019s longest-running cold cases. Like the death of Stalin, to which it is sometimes compared, the death of Alexander poses a mystery that is perhaps insoluble but nonetheless irresistible. Conspiracy buffs have been speculating about it since before the king\\u2019s body was cold, but recently there has been an extraordinary number of new accusers and new suspects. Fuel was added to the fire by Oliver Stone\\u2018s Alexander, released in 2004 with new versions in 2006 and 2008: a film that, whatever its artistic flaws, presents a historically informed theory about who killed Alexander and why. Few events have been as unexpected as the death of Alexander. The king had shown fantastic reserves of strength during his 12-year campaign through Asia, enduring severe hardships and taking on strenuous combat roles. Some had come to think of him as divine, an idea fostered, and perhaps entertained, by Alexander himself. In 325, fighting almost single-handed against South Asian warriors, Alexander had one of his lungs pierced by an arrow, yet soon afterwards he made the most arduous of his military marches, a 60-day trek along the barren coast of southern Iran. Consequently, when the king fell gravely ill and died two years later, the shock felt by his 50,000-strong army was intense. So was the confusion about who would next lead it, for Alexander had made no plans for succession and had as yet produced no legitimate heir (though one would be born shortly after his death). The sudden demise of such a commanding figure would indeed turn out to be a catastrophic turning point, the start of a half-century of instability and strife known today as the Wars of the Successors. Events of such magnitude inevitably prompt a search for causes. It is disturbing to think that blind chance \\u2013 a drink from the wrong stream or a bite from the wrong mosquito \\u2013 put the ancient world on a perilous new course. An explanation that keeps the change in human hands may in some ways be reassuring, even though it involves a darker view of Alexander\\u2019s relations with his Companions, the inner circle of friends and high-ranking officers that surrounded him in Babylon. Ancient historians have reached no consensus on the cause of Alexander\\u2019s death, though many attribute it to disease. In 1996 Eugene Borza, a scholar specialising in ancient Macedon, took part in a medical board of inquiry at the University of Maryland, which reached a diagnosis of typhoid fever; Borza has since defended that finding in print. Malaria, smallpox and leukaemia have also been proposed, with alcoholism, infection from the lung wound and grief \\u2013 Alexander\\u2019s close friend Hephaestion had died some months earlier \\u2013 often seen as complicating factors. But some historians are unwilling to identify a specific illness, or even to choose between illness or murder: two Alexander experts who once made this choice (one on each side) later changed their opinions to undecided. With historical research at an impasse, Alexander sleuths are reaching out for new ideas and new approaches. Armed with reports from toxicologists and forensic pathologists and delving themselves into criminal psychology, they are re-opening the Alexander file as an ongoing murder investigation. The idea that Alexander was murdered first gained wider attention in 2004, thanks to the ending of Stone\\u2019s film. In its epilogue Alexander\\u2019s senior general Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins), looking back over decades at his commander\\u2019s death, declares: \\u2018The truth is, we did kill him. By silence, we consented \\u2026 Because we couldn\\u2019t go on.\\u2019 Ptolemy then instructs the alarmed scribe recording his words to destroy what he has just written and start again. \\u2018You shall write: He died of disease, and in weakened condition.\\u2019 The idea that Alexander\\u2019s generals felt pushed too far by their master and colluded in his murder in order to stop him did not arise out of Stone\\u2019s famously plot-prone imagination. There is some evidence that not even Alexander\\u2019s senior commanders were willing to follow him anywhere. In India in 325 BC, at the eastern edge of the Indus river system, Alexander\\u2019s army staged a sit-down strike, when ordered to march eastward towards the Ganges. Even the highest ranking officers took part in the mutiny. Stone considered this episode a forerunner of the later murder conspiracy, since Alexander was again planning vast new campaigns at the time of his death. \\u2018I can\\u2019t believe that these men were going on with Alexander\\u2019 to Arabia and Carthage, he said in a 2008 interview at the University of California, Berkeley. Stone likewise drew on historical research for the idea that Ptolemy masterminded a cover-up of Alexander\\u2019s murder, but the waters he is wading in here are very murky indeed. The account Ptolemy tells his scribe to compose at the end of Alexander apparently represents a controversial ancient document called the Royal Journals. Though now lost it was summarised (in different versions) by Arrian and Plutarch, two Greek writers of the Roman Empire, who endorsed it as the most reliable record of Alexander\\u2019s last days. Some scholars, led by the Australian classicist Brian Bosworth, believe the Royal Journals were falsified to make Alexander\\u2019s death appear natural, just as Stone\\u2019s film represents (though in Bosworth\\u2019s view the culprit was Eumenes, Alexander\\u2019s court secretary, rather than Ptolemy). Others disagree, taking the Journals to be just what Arrian and Plutarch thought they were, an undoctored, day-by-day eyewitness account. * * * * * * The debate over the Royal Journals has huge implications for our understanding of Alexander\\u2019s death, because Arrian and Plutarch describe that event very differently to other ancient sources. Both authors say that Alexander became feverish after leaving a drinking party at the home of a friend named Medius. His fever grew worse over the course of 10 or 12 days (the two accounts differ in chronology), leading finally to a paralytic state in which the king could neither move nor speak. As his troops shuffled past his sickbed, Arrian reports, Alexander could only shift his eyes to say farewell to each one. Death followed the next day. But a variety of other accounts paint a very different picture and it was these that Stone followed in Alexander. In this alternate version Alexander was first stricken in the midst of the drinking party rather than afterward and, more importantly, just as he drained a huge cup of wine. These accounts say that Alexander felt a stabbing sensation in the back after downing the cup and cried aloud. From that point on these sources record a variety of symptoms, including great pain, convulsions and delirium, but they say little or nothing about fever, the keynote of the Plutarch and Arrian accounts. A stabbing pain following a drink of wine would clearly suggest poison, which is why Plutarch, in his biography of Alexander, vehemently denied that it had occurred. \\u2018Some writers think they have to say such things, as though composing the tragic finale of a great drama\\u2019, he sneered. Apparently the dispute between those who thought Alexander had died of disease and those who suspected murder \\u2013 essentially, those who did or did not trust the Royal Journals \\u2013 was already rife in Plutarch\\u2019s day. Probably all reports of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms were spun one way or the other and none can be trusted absolutely. For supporters of the poisoning scenario the central question is, of course, \\u2018whodunnit?\\u2019 Stone\\u2019s film is remarkably cagey about answering this question. In the scene that portrays the fatal banquet dark looks are exchanged among the Companions to show that they know Alexander\\u2019s cup contains poison, but no clue is given as to how it got there. By contrast many Greek and Roman writers were certain they knew not only who did it, but how and with what poison. With remarkable uniformity they pointed their fingers at Antipater, the senior general whom Alexander had left in charge of the Macedonian homeland, and at two of his sons, Cassander and Iollas. Antipater may indeed have had reason to want Alexander dead in the spring of 323 BC, for the king had just removed him from his post and summoned him to Babylon, perhaps with hostile intent. Antipater stayed put but sent Cassander in his stead. According to several ancient accounts Antipater sent with his son a draught of toxic water, collected from the legendary river Styx (believed to flow above ground in the northern Peloponnese before plunging down into the underworld). The water had to be transported in a hollowed-out mule\\u2019s hoof, for it was said to eat right through any other substance but horn. In Babylon, ran the story, Cassander passed this mule\\u2019s hoof to his brother Iollas \\u2013 conveniently enough, Alexander\\u2019s wine-pourer \\u2013 who then slipped the toxin into the king\\u2019s drink. The basic elements of this story are the same in every ancient retelling, but details vary. Some versions mention the philosopher Aristotle as a co-conspirator; he was a known friend of Antipater and probably estranged by that time from his former student Alexander, who had sanctioned the death of his relative Callisthenes. Others make Medius, the host of the final, fatal dinner party and allegedly Iollas\\u2019 male lover, a participant in the plot. One very early version, published in an anonymous Greek pamphlet, now known as The Last Days and Testament of Alexander, made Iollas doubly guilty: when the first draught of poison failed to kill Alexander, Iollas administered a second, soaking in Styx water the feather he used to help the king vomit. Until recently historians dismissed the story of the Styx water-poisoning as a fiction, possibly a political smear designed to harm Antipater and Cassander. Both were contestants for power in the era after Alexander\\u2019s death and had many enemies, especially Olympias, Alexander\\u2019s vengeful mother (who, perhaps to help foster the idea of Antipater\\u2019s family\\u2019s guilt, eventually had Iollas\\u2019 grave dug up and his ashes scattered to the wind). Even the idea that ordinary Greek river water could have toxic properties seemed absurd. In 1913 the distinguished classicist J.G. Frazer declared that the waters the Greeks identified as the Styx, today called Blackwater or Mavroneri, contained no toxins and there the matter rested for almost a century. But, in a presentation at a conference in Barcelona in 2010, the historian Adrienne Mayor and the toxicologist Antoinette Hayes proposed that the limestone around Mavroneri could easily have nurtured a lethal bacterium called calicheamicin. Chemical tests are being planned to determine whether such bacteria are still present today (though they may have disappeared over the centuries). Mayor and Hayes argue that \\u2018calicheamicin could cause illness and death like that described for Alexander\\u2019 \\u2013 including his high fever, usually seen as proof of a natural death. The research of Mayor and Hayes might suggest that Alexander was murdered, though the authors themselves stop short of that claim. They are more interested in explaining the legend than the death itself. Their thesis that the Styx really was strongly toxic would account for why Antipater and his sons were the ancient world\\u2019s prime suspects: Cassander\\u2019s journey from Europe to Babylon just a few weeks before the onset of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms provided an obvious conduit by which Styx water could have arrived at the king\\u2019s banquet table. (Cassander later helped confirm the ancient world\\u2019s suspicions about him by usurping the throne of Macedonia and executing Alexander\\u2019s mother, wife and son.) The authors are also interested in how, in the Greek imagination, the mythic resonance of the Styx, a river thought able to stupefy even the gods, made it an ideal weapon for Antipater and his sons to use. \\u2018Such a sacred drug would lend an aura of divinity to Alexander\\u2019, Mayor said recently. \\u2018An ordinary, common drug would not do. Only a very rare, potent and legendary substance would be appropriate for Alexander.\\u2019 It remains to be seen whether such glosses on the legend of Antipater\\u2019s conspiracy can help crack the mystery. But it is clear that the Mayor-Hayes approach, matching toxins available to the ancient world with Alexander\\u2019s reported symptoms, has become an increasingly popular route into that mystery. Three other investigators have pursued it in recent years, combining it with three new hypotheses about who might have administered the toxin: Ptolemy, one of Alexander\\u2019s leading generals, committed the murder with arsenic; Rhoxane, the king\\u2019s wife, did it with strychnine; Alexander\\u2019s physicians did it, but by accident, with powdered hellebore root. The last of these theories emerged from the unlikely collaboration of the New Zealand toxicologist Leo Schep and the Scotland Yard detective John Grieve. These two men were brought together in a 2009 television documentary, Alexander the Great\\u2019s Mysterious Death. Schep had by that time arrived at the conclusion that powdered white hellebore, used medicinally by the ancient Greeks but lethal in large doses, could best account for Alexander\\u2019s recorded symptoms. Grieve then made the guess that the hellebore was not delivered by an assassin, as Schep had supposed, but by Alexander\\u2019s doctors, who accidentally overdosed their patient while trying to cure him. Grieve\\u2019s ingenious speculation is only that, but has already won the endorsement of at least one Alexander specialist, the British classicist Richard Stoneman. \\u2018Hellebore, despite its dangers, was the favourite prescription of many ancient doctors because of its violent purgative effects\\u2019, Stoneman notes. \\u2018But it was easy to get the dose wrong, and Alexander\\u2019s doctors might have had access to an unfamiliar strain of the drug in Babylon \\u2013 or even misread the Babylonian label.\\u2019 But the toxicology on which Schep and Grieve rely is evidently not an exact science, especially when practiced at a distance of 2,300 years. The author Graham Phillips submitted the same record of Alexander\\u2019s symptoms as Schep\\u2019s to the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Center but obtained a very different answer. In his 2004 book Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon Phillips maintains that only strychnine could have produced a death like Alexander\\u2019s. Following a twisting, at times tortuous, trail of logic Phillips tries to identify Alexander\\u2019s murderer by finding out who had access to strychnine. The poisonous plant is rare along Alexander\\u2019s route of march and could be harvested only in high elevation regions of the subcontinent (modern Pakistan). Not all of Alexander\\u2019s retinue followed him into such areas, allowing Phillips to eliminate potential suspects. He concludes that only one person who might have had a motive to kill Alexander also had the means: Rhoxane, the first of the king\\u2019s three wives. She had become enraged at Alexander, Phillips assumes, by his two subsequent marriages to Persian princesses and killed him. This view of Rhoxane as a latter-day Medea revives one popularised in the 17th-century English tragedy by Nataniel Lee, The Rival Queens, but is not supported by evidence. (Oliver Stone, too, portrays Rhoxane as a murderously jealous woman, though he makes her guilty of the death of Hephaestion \\u2013 in his view, Alexander\\u2019s male lover \\u2013 rather than Alexander himself.) Arsenic gets the spotlight in a 2004 book, The Death of Alexander the Great by Paul Doherty, novelist and amateur historian. Doherty lays particular stress on a macabre piece of evidence mentioned by Plutarch and the Roman writer Quintus Curtius: Alexander\\u2019s body did not decay even after lying exposed to the summer heat of Babylon for a week or more. Doherty cites toxicology studies of the 19th century to show that arsenic poisoning can lead to mummification. However the jury seems to be out on this point and, for obvious reasons, opportunities for field tests are few. If Alexander\\u2019s body really did resist decomposition \\u2013 and some experts consider the story a fiction \\u2013 then numerous explanations have to be considered. Those who believe Alexander drank himself to death have claimed that his corpse was more or less pickled in alcohol. Strychnine, hellebore and the calicheamicin bacteria have all been given preservative properties by their various adherents. Defenders of the disease scenario give an entirely different and more disturbing reason for the non-decay phenomenon: Alexander, in their view, only appeared to die on June 11th; he actually entered a deep coma. He may still have been barely alive when embalmers arrived many days later to disembowel him. Doherty\\u2019s book uses some intriguing guesswork to arrive at Ptolemy as its lead suspect. Ptolemy got the best post-Alexander assignment of any of the leading generals, a posting in wealthy Egypt. He eventually established an independent kingdom there that endured for centuries, until finally lost by his descendant Cleopatra in 30 BC. Doherty argues backward from Ptolemy\\u2019s later success, reasoning that he who gained the most from Alexander\\u2019s death had the greatest incentive to bring it about. It is the same thinking that Oliver Stone used when he made Ptolemy a principal member of the murder plot depicted in Alexander. As the director said in the Berkeley interview: \\u2018I go back to [the film] JFK: Cui bono? Who benefits?\\u2019 It is startling to think that Ptolemy or Rhoxane, two people normally regarded as dependent on and devoted to Alexander, may have wanted him dead, but those possibilities cannot be ruled out. Neither can Stone\\u2019s hypothesis that the entire general staff colluded in Alexander\\u2019s murder, at least by not intervening to prevent it (\\u2018By silence we consented\\u2019). Indeed John Atkinson, a South African classicist, has put forward a scenario very much like that of Stone\\u2019s film in a 2009 journal article entitled \\u2018Alexander\\u2019s Last Days: Malaria and Mind Games?\\u2019 (co-authored with two medical specialists, Elsie and Etienne Truter). Like Stone, Atkinson portrays an Alexander who in his final months was feared and mistrusted by his closest associates. \\u2018The officers were dealing with a man who had become paranoid and cheap\\u2019, he and his co-authors write. \\u2018Men who valued their own lives would have no wish to be led by one who might again risk his own life and put his men into unnecessary mortal danger.\\u2019 In Atkinson\\u2019s view the campaigns Alexander had in mind in June 323 BC \\u2013 including conquest of Arabia, Carthage and the entire Mediterranean coast \\u2013 were a bridge too far for Alexander\\u2019s officers. Having turned him back from the East by mutiny, he argues, these men now felt only death could stop him from taking on the West. Even while regarding Alexander as a pariah to his own people, Atkinson rejects the idea that he was poisoned, seemingly on the grounds of his symptoms. His verdict is something closer to euthanasia: after the king became ill his inner circle pushed him toward death using the \\u2018mind games\\u2019 of the article\\u2019s title. \\u2018The officers in Alexander\\u2019s court had the opportunity to work on his mind and undermine his will to survive\\u2019, Atkinson writes. \\u2018Maybe he reached the point of believing that the only heroic thing left for him to do was to die.\\u2019 And so the debate goes on with new paths leading to darker mysteries and raising increasingly difficult questions. Ironically the net result of recent theorising has been to create greater uncertainty than ever, even to break down the longstanding dichotomy between illness and poison scenarios. Mayor and Hayes raise the possibility that Alexander died of an illness but was nonetheless murdered; John Grieve suspects he was poisoned, but by accident. Atkinson makes the case that Alexander\\u2019s death was neither entirely criminal nor entirely natural, but something in between. If the embalmed body of Alexander is ever found \\u2013 and some researchers continue to hunt for it \\u2013 we may finally learn what caused his death, but the mummy disappeared from view in the third or fourth century AD (it had been displayed before that in a sumptuous monument at Alexandria). Meanwhile investigators will continue to pore over the records left behind by Plutarch, Arrian, Diodorus, Justin and Quintus Curtius. Unfortunately the pool of textual data is large enough to allow multiple ways of connecting the dots. With physical remains lacking and written testimony ambiguous the burden of proof in the Alexander case falls heavily on circumstantial evidence and much of this presents a grave challenge to all conspiracy theories. Opponents of such theories have long noted that Alexander himself, during the 10 or 12 days he slid towards death, never gave any sign that he suspected poison, though he had become quick to sniff out and punish traitors in his final years. He would never have gone willingly to his death (as Oliver Stone\\u2019s film appears to imply), nor would his enemies have allowed him to linger so long if they had in fact acted against him. A slow decline would allow him to order their executions. To assert that Alexander was poisoned one would have to admit that the job was badly bungled. The same point could be made about what followed Alexander\\u2019s death. The chaos and collapse in the succeeding decades looks nothing like the result of a planned assassination. If the goal of the generals was to \\u2018go home and spend their dough\\u2019, as Oliver Stone asserted in his Berkeley interview, they failed miserably. None ever returned to Macedonia and only Ptolemy succeeded in gaining any measure of peace or security. Many of the others continued fighting and killing each other. Given how central Alexander was to the stability of their world, they had no reason in June 323 BC to expect otherwise. Any plan to poison Alexander would have been fraught with perils, especially for Macedonian warriors who had no experience with toxins. Conspiracy theories have to assume that Alexander\\u2019s generals hated their commander enough to risk everything. It is easier to see them in the way the sources portray them: as a dedicated cadre of elite officers reliant for their fortunes on the survival and success of their king. Thus it is easier, in the end, to believe that Alexander died of disease, despite ingenious and determined recent efforts to prove otherwise. About the Author:\\nJames Romm is James H.
